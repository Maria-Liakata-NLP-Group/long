Let's cross our fingers for better weather tomorrow.","53":" \"Maybe if we all wish hard enough, the rain will go away!\"","54":" \"Hey, anything is worth a shot. Here goes nothing!\"","55":"My favourite pet is a dog. I love how they're so loyal and loving!","56":"Mine is a cat!

And all the outdoor activities that come with warmer weather are great too!","64":"Do you guys think it will stay warm or cool off soon?","65":"It looks like temperatures will stay pretty steady in the next few weeks.","66":"That's good news. I don't think my AC can handle any more heat than what we've already had this summer!","67":"I heard there might be some rain coming our way soon. That should help cool things down a bit.","68":"That would be nice. We haven't seen rain in a while now.","69":"Yeah, it definitely seems like it's been dry lately. Fingers crossed for some precipitation soon!","70":"I hope so too! Rain always makes everything feel a little bit fresher.","71":"Indeed! Maybe we'll even get a chance to see some lightning and thunder.","72":"That would be awesome! Nothing beats a good thunderstorm on a hot summer day.","73":"Amen to that! It just adds something extra special to an already beautiful season.","74":"I can't believe how much I miss watching old childhood TV shows!","75":"Me too! I used to love Power Rangers and Pokemon.","76":"Ahhh the nostalgia! I think my favorite was Digimon.","77":"Oh that brings back so many memories! Even though kids TV shows aren't what they used to be, there's still a few good ones like My Little Pony and Adventure Time.","78":"Those are great! But nothing beats the classics like Rugrats and Hey Arnold!","79":"Exactly! I also loved Batman Beyond, The Wild Thornberrys, and Doug!","80":"Those are all such great shows. But Don't forget about The Simpsons and Spongebob Squarepants!","81":"Oh yeah those were such staples of my childhood. There's something special about the innocence of 90s cartoons that we don't see today.","82":"That's so true! I'm always surprised at how much these old shows stay with us as adults. Thanks for sharing your thoughts everyone :-)","83":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for all the old children's TV programmes I used to watch!","84":"Oh yes! I remember watching Tiny Toon Adventures when I was a kid. What shows did you watch?","85":"I loved Hey Arnold and Rugrats!

And who can forget the classic The Magic School Bus?! It was always a blast to tune into that one!!","90":"And let's not forget Recess either! It taught us so much about friendship and life lessons.","91":"Ahh Recess and The Magic School Bus were classics. Makes me wish I could watch them again sometimes!","92":"It's been so hot the past few days! I'm not used to this kind of heat.","93":"I know what you mean! It's definitely unusual for this time of year.","94":"It was so sunny yesterday that I even got sunburned!","95":"That's never happened to me before! I'm hoping for some clouds soon.","96":"Me too - it would be great if we had some rain too!","97":"I heard there might be a thunderstorm later this week. That would help cool things down a bit!","98":"That would be great! I'm really looking forward to it now.","99":"Me too - hopefully it will give us some much needed relief from the heat!","100":"I agree. But until then, I think I'll just stay inside with the air conditioning on!","101":"That sounds like a good plan. I'm tired of feeling like it's 100 degrees outside!","102":"LOL, same here. A thunderstorm is definitely needed ASAP!","103":"Agreed! Hopefully it arrives soon and gives us all a break from the heatwave.","104":"It's so hot outside! I'm sweating just walking to my car.","105":"I hear you - it's been scorching here too. Is there any relief in sight?","106":"Not that I can see. Even the trees seem to be wilting!","107":"Maybe a storm will come soon and cool things off a bit.","108":"That would be nice, but I think we have weeks of this heat left yet.","109":"Let's hope for some thunderstorms at least!","110":"Agreed. A change of pace would be much-needed.","111":"In the meantime, let's stay inside and keep cool!","112":"My all-time favourite pet is a dog. They are loyal and loving companions.","113":"I agree, dogs are the best! What about you @User3?","114":"I'm a cat person myself. They're independent and so much fun to play with!","115":"Dogs and cats are both awesome! I personally love rabbits because they're so fluffy and playful.","116":"Totally, rabbits are great pets! I also love fish because of their calming presence in the home.","117":"Fish are cool! I prefer reptiles though, like turtles and lizards. They're fascinating to watch!","118":"Absolutely! Reptiles make great pets. Another one of my favourites is the hamster \u2013 they're so cute and silly!","119":"That's true, hamsters can be really entertaining. What about you @User4?","120":"I definitely appreciate all kinds of animals, but nothing beats playing with a puppy or kitten.","121":"Aww that sounds lovely! My personal favourite is the guinea pig. They have such sweet personalities.","122":"Guinea pigs are great too! I think my top pick would have to be birds \u2013 they sing so beautifully.","123":"Birds can certainly brighten up any home. Personally, I'm partial to hedgehogs \u2013 they're so cute when they curl up!","124":"Hedgehogs are adorable indeed! For me it's hard to pick just one favourite pet - they all bring something unique to the table.","125":"That's true \u2013 each pet has its own special qualities that make it endearing in its own way!","126":" \"I couldn't agree more! It's amazing how different animals can bring joy into our lives :)\"","127":" \"Indeed - there's nothing quite like having a furry friend by your side!\"","128":" \"You said it!

I'm already breaking out the sunscreen.","135":"Hey, what's your favourite pet?","136":"I love cats! They're very independent and they always make me laugh.","137":"That's true! I'm more of a dog person myself. They're really loyal and always up for an adventure.","138":"That sounds great too! Do you have any pets yourself?","139":"Yes, I have a Labrador called Jack. He's my best bud!","140":"Aww, that's so cute. What do you like to do with him?","141":"We go for lots of walks on the beach and play fetch. He loves it!","142":"That sounds like so much fun! I wish I had a pet like that.","143":"It's so hot today! I can't believe how much hotter it's been this summer.","144":"I know right? It doesn't look like the heatwave is going to end anytime soon.","145":"Ugh, I'm so over this weather. Does anyone know of any cool places to escape the heat?","146":"Actually, the temperature has dropped significantly up north. That might be a good place to go!","147":"Yeah, it's definitely still hot here in the city but not as bad as before. Plus there are some great places to hang out that are air conditioned!","148":"That sounds nice! I'm planning on going camping next weekend and hopefully it will be cooler away from town.","149":"I hope so! But don't forget to check the forecast before you head out!","150":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for the childrens TV programmes of my youth - do you have any favourites?","151":"Absolutely!

It's always nice to look back on these old shows with fondness.","156":"Definitely! We should start a nostalgia thread and discuss our favourites :)","157":"Hi everyone! Is anyone else feeling the heat today?","158":"Yeah, it's really hot out there. I'm sweating buckets!","159":"It's supposed to be even hotter tomorrow according to the forecast.","160":"Ugh, I'm dreading it. Does anyone know what the humidity is like?","161":"It's pretty high right now. Might be a good idea to stay indoors if you can.","162":"Good point! The heat might be dangerous for some people.","163":"I heard that thunderstorms are on their way later this week as well.","164":"Really? That would be nice - could use a bit of a break from all this heat!","165":"Yes please! I guess we just have to wait and see what happens.","166":"Yep! Let's hope for rain soon.","167":"I'm feeling nostalgic for all the great kids' TV shows I used to watch growing up!","168":"Same!

It's definitely a commitment but worth it in the end.","207":"Fish tanks create such a peaceful atmosphere -it's no wonder why people keep these as pets for decades or even generations!","208":"Cats have distinct personalities that make each one unique and special which keeps things exciting for me as an owner.","209":"You can't help but smile when your dog greets you with enthusiasm every single time! That kind of unconditional love makes it all worthwhile.","210":"Rabbits need plenty of space so they can hop around. Watching them explore their environment is one of my favourite pastimes when I'm bored at home.","211":"Reptiles have some pretty remarkable adaptations that allow them to thrive in almost any environment. It's truly fascinating how resilient they can be!","212":"The best thing about having fish is that they don't require too much work once you get everything set up correctly.

What do you think the temperature will be like over the weekend?","245":"I think it might stay pretty warm but hopefully not as hot as it has been lately.","246":"Agreed. It would be nice if we could get some relief from this heatwave.","247":"If only there was something we could do to make sure we got cooler temperatures!","248":"Maybe we should all go outside and dance around in a circle?

I'd love to try it out.","250":"I think we should just keep our fingers crossed and hope for cooler temperatures instead!","251":"Sounds like a plan! Let's keep an eye on the forecast and hopefully get what we're wishing for.","252":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for the TV shows I used to watch as a kid.

It's hard to find something like that nowadays.","256":"My favourite pet is a dog because they are loyal, friendly and always happy to see you!","257":"I love cats! They're so independent and have their own personalities.","258":"I prefer hamsters! They're so small and cute and they don't need much space!","259":"That's true, I think all pets are amazing in their own way!","260":"My favourite pet is a cat because they are so cuddly and loving!","261":"I can't get enough of my little puppy! They're always so eager to play and show love.","262":"I love my hamster - they're so cute and often quite cheeky!","263":"My turtle is the best.

Such great memories from our childhoods. :)","2670":"Hey, what's your favourite pet?","2671":"I love cats! They're very independent and they always make me laugh.","2672":"That's true! I'm more of a dog person myself. They're really loyal and always up for an adventure.","2673":"That sounds great too! Do you have any pets yourself?","2674":"Yes, I have a Labrador called Jack. He's my best bud!","2675":"Aww, that's so cute. What do you like to do with him?","2676":"We go for lots of walks on the beach and play fetch. He loves it!","2677":"That sounds like so much fun!

Though nothing beats the companionship of having a furry friend like a dog or cat around the house.\"","2689":" \"That's true - my pup always cheers me up when I'm feeling down. Pets are such great sources of comfort and joy!\"","2690":" \"Exactly - no matter what kind of pet you have, they always bring something special into our lives.\"","2691":" \"I couldn't agree more! Animals are so full of personality and love that we just can't help but be drawn to them.\"","2692":" \"Sure thing - even if you don't own one yourself, there's something special about being able to appreciate all kinds of different animals from afar too!\"","2693":" \"Yes! We should treasure every creature on this planet for the unique gifts each species has to offer us humans.\"","2694":" \"Amen to that! From furry friends to scaly ones, each animal brings something special into our lives that we should be grateful for.\"","2695":" \"Indeed! To me personally, there's something especially magical about spending time with my pet snake - she's always so curious and energetic!\"","2696":" \"Oh wow, that sounds like quite the experience. Reptiles certainly have their own unique charm which makes them stand out from other animals!\"","2697":" \"I can imagine! It must feel amazing when your pet trusts you enough to explore its environment with you around :)\"","2698":" \"It truly does. Pets are such remarkable creatures who always find ways to surprise us with their intelligence and surprises!\"","2699":" \"Yup yup!

Rainy days are so cozy.","2833":"True, but I have plans later so I don't want it to be too wet!","2834":"I think the weather is going to hold for a bit longer. It's just the clouds that make it look like it's about to rain.","2835":"That would be great! I need to go out and do some errands.","2836":"Maybe we'll get lucky and the sun will come out soon!","2837":"I don't think so, the forecast says there's supposed to be rain in the afternoon.","2838":"Well, either way let's hope for the best!","2839":"I'm just glad it hasn't been too hot lately.

That one is timeless in my opinion!","3330":" \"The Simpsons is definitely up there on my list as well. It's still running after all these years!\"","3331":" \"Wow, that's amazing! There must be something special about it if it has lasted this long.\"","3332":" \"It certainly does stand out from the rest. Any other shows anyone remembers?\"","3333":" \"I used to love watching Animaniacs when I was a kid. Those musical numbers still get stuck in my head from time to time!\"","3334":" \"Ahh yes, Animaniacs were awesome! What about Looney Tunes? Those classic cartoons never get old for me.\"","3335":" \"You can't go wrong with Looney Tunes - their humour is timeless for sure. Anything else anyone would like to add?\"","3336":" \"I always liked Darkwing Duck when I was younger - that show had a bit of everything: comedy, action and drama!\"","3337":" \"Ooooh yeah, Darkwing Duck was fantastic - another underrated gem! Anyone else have any more childhood classics they'd like to mention?\"","3338":" \"Rescue Rangers will always hold a special place for me - those animals were way too cute for words!\"","3339":" \"Hehe yeah Rescue Rangers are definitely hard to forget! How 'bout some Nickelodeon classics like CatDog or Hey Dude?\"","3340":" \"CatDog was hilarious and Hey Dude made me feel like I could go on an adventure anytime I wanted - they both brought back lots of fun memories!\"","3341":" \"Excellent choices everyone - let's keep up the nostalgia-fest here!\"","3342":"It's been really hot the past few days!","3343":"I know! I'm so glad I have air conditioning.","3344":"I don't have air conditioning. It's been a struggle!","3345":"It looks like it's going to rain soon though.","3346":"That would be great! I could use some relief from the heat.","3347":"Me too, but I'm worried about landslides and flooding if the rain is too heavy.","3348":"We should definitely keep an eye on the news for updates on this weather pattern.","3349":"Yes! Do you think it might cool down after it rains?","3350":"It should help a little, but unfortunately we're still in for a hot summer ahead of us.","3351":"Ugh, that's not what I wanted to hear...","3352":"Maybe we can try to find ways to stay cool during the hottest days?","3353":"Definitely! Maybe putting up some shade or investing in an inflatable pool?","3354":"Cool idea! Anything else people can do to beat the heat?","3355":"I heard that keeping your curtains closed during the day helps keep your house cooler!","3356":"That's true - also leaving bowls of ice around helps as well!","3357":" \"Those are great tips - anything else anyone knows of?\"","3358":" \"Try not to go outside too much during the peak daylight hours. That always makes it worse for me.\"","3359":" \"Yeah, and make sure you drink plenty of water - that'll help keep you cool too.\"","3360":" \"What about using fans? Does anyone know if those work better than ACs?\"","3361":" \"Fans definitely help circulate air and might be cheaper than getting an AC unit installed. However, they won't actually lower the temperature of a room.\"","3362":" \"Ah okay. Thanks for clarifying - good thing I already have an AC unit then!\"","3363":" \"Haha yeah same here. Any other advice on dealing with this heatwave everyone? Let's brainstorm!\"","3364":" \"Maybe eating cold foods like ice cream and popsicles could help distract from the heat a bit?\"","3365":" \"That sounds like a great plan! Who else has any ideas to add?\"","3366":"My favourite pet is a cat. They're so fluffy and cuddly!","3367":"I love my dog because it's always so happy to see me!","3368":"I love my parrot because it can talk back to me and make me laugh!","3369":"That's so cool! I'd love to have a pet that could talk too.","3370":"I used to love watching the old Disney cartoons when I was a kid!","3371":"Oh yes, I remember them! Especially classics like The Lion King and Aladdin.","3372":"Do any of you guys remember the old Nickelodeon shows? My favorite was Rugrats!","3373":"I do! That show was hilarious. And hey, did anyone here watch Hey Arnold?","3374":"Yes, definitely! Hey Arnold was one of my favorites too. It was so nostalgic!","3375":"Ahh, I miss those days! What about everyone else? Any other shows you all miss?","3376":"Oh yeah, I used to adore Powerpuff Girls and Courage the Cowardly Dog!","3377":"Those were great shows. But what about Spongebob Squarepants? Now that's a classic for sure.","3378":"It sure is! Nothing quite beats Spongebob for nostalgia. Anyone else have anything to add?","3379":"My all-time favourite pet is a dog. They are loyal and loving companions.","3380":"I agree, dogs are the best! What about you @User3?","3381":"I'm a cat person myself. They're independent and so much fun to play with!","3382":"Dogs and cats are both awesome! I personally love rabbits because they're so fluffy and playful.","3383":"Totally, rabbits are great pets! I also love fish because of their calming presence in the home.","3384":"Fish are cool! I prefer reptiles though, like turtles and lizards. They're fascinating to watch!","3385":"Absolutely! Reptiles make great pets. Another one of my favourites is the hamster \u2013 they're so cute and silly!","3386":"That's true, hamsters can be really entertaining. What about you @User4?","3387":"I definitely appreciate all kinds of animals, but nothing beats playing with a puppy or kitten.","3388":"Aww that sounds lovely! My personal favourite is the guinea pig. They have such sweet personalities.","3389":"Guinea pigs are great too! I think my top pick would have to be birds \u2013 they sing so beautifully.","3390":"Birds can certainly brighten up any home. Personally, I'm partial to hedgehogs \u2013 they're so cute when they curl up!","3391":"Hedgehogs are adorable indeed! For me it's hard to pick just one favourite pet - they all bring something unique to the table.","3392":"That's true \u2013 each pet has its own special qualities that make it endearing in its own way!","3393":" \"I couldn't agree more! It's amazing how different animals can bring joy into our lives :)\"","3394":" \"Indeed - there's nothing quite like having a furry friend by your side!\"","3395":" \"You said it! All pets have something special about them that makes them worth loving \u2665\"","3396":"It's raining cats and dogs outside, isn't it?","3397":"Yeah, it's been like this all day long!","3398":"I heard the forecast said it would clear up tonight.","3399":"That would be nice! I'm so tired of the rain.","3400":"Have any of you noticed how chilly it's getting too?","3401":"Yes, I've definitely felt a drop in temperature. It's probably because of all the rain.","3402":"Ugh, I was really looking forward to going out today too...","3403":"It looks like we're stuck inside for awhile!","3404":"Maybe we can find something to do online to pass the time until the weather clears up.","3405":"Good idea! What did everyone have in mind?","3406":"We could play some games or watch movies together virtually.","3407":"I'd be down for that. Does anyone know any good games we can play together?","3408":"I heard there's this great game called 'Townsfolk' that several players can join at once. Might be fun!","3409":"That sounds cool! Let's give it a try!","3410":"Sure, but first let's see if this rain is ever going to stop...","3411":"I think some sunshine would do us all some good right about now!","3412":"Agreed! Let's cross our fingers for better weather tomorrow.","3413":" \"Maybe if we all wish hard enough, the rain will go away!\"","3414":" \"Hey, anything is worth a shot. Here goes nothing!\"","3415":"It's so hot and humid today!","3416":"I know! It's unbearable. I'm already sweating.","3417":"Does anyone know what the temperature is outside?","3418":"It's around 100 degrees Fahrenheit here.","3419":"Wow, that's way too hot. I hope it cools down soon.","3420":"Yeah, I don't think I can take much more of this heat!","3421":"I heard there are thunderstorms in the forecast for tonight.","3422":"That would be a welcome relief from this heat wave!","3423":"Yes, rain would be great right now.","3424":"Let's keep our fingers crossed that it actually happens!","3425":"So what else has been going on with the weather lately?","3426":"I've heard reports of high winds in some areas recently.","3427":"That sounds dangerous! Hopefully everyone stays safe.","3428":"I heard there was a tornado warning earlier this week in another state.","3429":"That must have been scary for those affected by it.","3430":"Definitely. It can be difficult to stay safe during severe weather conditions like that.","3431":"Has anyone seen any reports of snow in their area?","3432":"Not yet! But it is still early in the season, so we should expect some eventually.","3433":"Do you think we'll get any snow where we are?","3434":"Maybe! We haven't had any for a few years now so who knows!","3435":" \"Snow would be nice but I'd rather have cooler temperatures without all the wetness!\"","3436":" \"Agreed. Maybe Mother Nature will surprise us with both!\"","3437":" \"Stranger things have happened! Let's keep our eyes on the forecast and see what happens next...\"","3438":" \"Sounds like a plan! Stay tuned and hopefully we'll get something good soon :)\"","3439":"Hey everyone, what's the weather like where you are?","3440":"It's cloudy and cool here in Chicago.","3441":"It's sunny and humid here in Texas!","3442":"I'm in Florida, and it's hot and sunny!","3443":"That sounds great! I'm stuck inside with the rain today.","3444":"Oh no, that doesn't sound fun. Hopefully it'll clear up soon!","3445":"Maybe we can all plan a vacation somewhere warm?","3446":"That would be awesome! Where should we go?","3447":"What about Mexico? It's always so beautiful there.","3448":"I love Mexico! That sounds great to me.","3449":"Me too! Let's start planning our trip!","3450":"What's the weather like today?","3451":"It's sunny and really hot!","3452":"That sounds great! I'm looking forward to spending some time outside.","3453":"I heard there's going to be a thunderstorm later this afternoon.","3454":"Really? That's not what the forecast said this morning.","3455":"It's always best to check the radar and prepare for the worst!","3456":"Good advice! So what should we do if it does rain?","3457":"I guess make sure you have an umbrella handy!","3458":"Good idea. Are there any other precautions we should take?","3459":"If it gets really bad, you might want to secure any outdoor furniture or decorations.","3460":"Yes, and don't forget about your pets - make sure they're safe too!","3461":"Thanks for all the advice everyone. Let's keep an eye on things and stay safe!","3462":"My favorite pet is a dog because they're so loyal and loving!","3463":"I love cats too! They're always so cute and playful.","3464":"I'm a big fan of reptiles. They have such unique personalities.","3465":"Birds are my favorite! There's something so calming about listening to their chirping.","3466":"I agree, birds are great companions. But dogs will always be my number one!","3467":"Yeah, cats are pretty awesome. I like that they don't need as much attention as dogs do.","3468":"Reptiles can be really interesting to observe. Plus, they make great low-maintenance pets!","3469":"Absolutely! I find birds to be incredibly therapeutic animals. They bring me a lot of joy and happiness.","3470":"That's true, birds can definitely be very calming. Dogs are just so full of energy though!","3471":"Sure, cats require less attention but that also means you get less cuddles! :)","3472":"My favourite pet is a dog because they're so loyal.","3473":"I also love dogs, but I think cats are the best. They're so independent and don't need as much attention.","3474":"I'm a big fan of rabbits! They're so cute and cuddly!","3475":"I have to agree with User 3 - rabbits are the cutest. Plus, they can be litter trained!","3476":"My favourite pet is a horse. There's something about their intelligence and beauty that's just mesmerizing.","3477":"Fish are great too! They don't require much maintenance and you can watch them swim around in their tank all day long.","3478":"I'm more of a bird person - I love how they can fly and make sounds. It's really peaceful to listen to them sing.","3479":"Guinea pigs are adorable! They're so small and gentle, plus they have such cute little faces!","3480":"I like lizards because they can be fun to watch scurry around. And some of them even change colours!","3481":"Hamsters are awesome because they're always on the go! Watching them run in their wheel is the best entertainment ever.","3482":"My absolute favourite pet is a turtle - they're slow but cute, plus you get to watch them grow from tiny babies into big adults!","3483":"It sure has been hot out lately.","3484":"I know! It's been over 100\u00b0F for the past week.","3485":"The heat wave doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon either.","3486":"Yeah, I heard it's going to last until the end of August at least.","3487":"That means I won't be able to go camping this weekend like I had planned.","3488":"At least you can stay inside and stay cool with the AC!","3489":"Maybe a nice pool day would be a better idea in this weather?","3490":"Definitely! A little sun and some swimming is just what we need.","3491":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for childhood TV programmes. What about you guys?","3492":"Definitely! I was a huge fan of the Rugrats!","3493":"Oh yeah, I remember that! I used to love watching Hey Arnold too.","3494":"That's right! Hey Arnold was so much fun.

It's hard to find something like that nowadays.","3504":"I have a cat! They're so playful and loving. My cat always curls up on my lap when I'm feeling down.","3505":"My favorite pet is a dog! They are loyal and friendly, I can't imagine life without them!","3506":"I just adopted a rabbit! Rabbits are great companions and they always make me laugh.","3507":"I love birds! They're so colorful and cheerful. Watching them flutter around the house is calming.","3508":"I have two guinea pigs. They're fun to cuddle with and they always make me smile.","3509":"That's awesome Evelyn! Guinea pigs are so sweet.","3510":"Yeah, I never had a bird before but it sounds great Dave!","3511":"Awww Bob, dogs are the best pets ever. I totally agree!","3512":"Thanks Bob! Birds bring so much joy to my home.","3513":"Agreed Alice - guinea pigs are super adorable!","3514":"What's your favourite pet and why?","3515":"My favourite pet is a dog. I love how loyal and loving they are!","3516":"That's a great choice! I've always wanted to get a dog.","3517":"You should do it! Dogs make great companions!","3518":"I'm definitely considering it.

We need some rain soon!","3524":"I hope it starts raining soon! I'm ready for some cooler weather.","3525":"It's supposed to cool down a bit later in the week. Let's keep our fingers crossed.","3526":"Any chance of thunderstorms too?","3527":"The forecast doesn't show any storms at this time. But you never know!","3528":"I heard there might be a heat wave coming up soon. Ugh!","3529":"Oh no! That would be terrible. Hopefully not!","3530":"We should just enjoy the cooler weather while we can and take advantage of it!","3531":"Yes, let's make sure to get out and enjoy nature before it gets too hot again!","3532":"Agreed! Maybe going swimming would be fun too :)","3533":"Definitely! That sounds like a great idea.","3534":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for the childrens TV programmes of my youth - do you have any favourites?","3535":"Absolutely! I loved watching 'The Magic Roundabout' when I was a kid!","3536":"That's such a classic! I also had a soft spot for 'Bagpuss'.","3537":"'Bagpuss' is fantastic! What's your favourite character from that show?","3538":"I think it has to be Madeleine the rag doll. She was always so sweet!","3539":"Agreed! It's always nice to look back on these old shows with fondness.","3540":"Definitely! We should start a nostalgia thread and discuss our favourites :)","3541":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for my favorite childhood TV program - Rugrats!","3542":"Same! I loved watching Tommy pick on his little brother Dil!","3543":"Ahh, I'm still so fond of the memories of Doug and his alter-ego Quailman.","3544":"Oh yeah! I miss the old Nickelodeon shows like The Wild Thornberrys too!","3545":"It's not just Nickelodeon. Remember when Disney had Doug on their channel?","3546":"Of course! I almost forgot about Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Bear in the Big Blue House.","3547":"Oh yes, those were great! Nowadays there are so many new shows that it's hard to keep up with them all.","3548":"Yup, it's definitely a different world now compared to when we were younger. It was nice to have a few familiar shows that aired on a regular basis!","3549":"Agreed! Do any other forum members have any fond memories from their childhoods?","3550":"Absolutely! Recess was one of my favorites. It taught me how to deal with bullies and make friends at school.","3551":"Recess was awesome. Also remember Rocko's Modern Life? Those were good times!","3552":"Yup! The mix of cartoons between the 90s and early 2000s was incredible. We should be thankful for those moments.","3553":"Definitely! Let's cherish the nostalgia while looking forward to what new cartoons will come out in the future :)","3554":"My favourite pet is a dog because they are so loyal and loving!","3555":"I love cats too!

They're small, quiet and low-maintenance.","3567":"I have to go with birds - they're so colourful and beautiful, plus they can talk!","3568":"Fish are my top pick. Watching them swim around in the tank is so calming.","3569":"Horses are amazing animals. They have such an intelligence about them that other animals don't possess.","3570":"Turtles are really cool too! I like how slow and peaceful they move around their tank or pond.","3571":"Goats are pretty awesome pets. They don't need much space or care but will still show affection to you!","3572":"Snakes are fascinating creatures as well. You can learn a lot from watching them move around their habitat.","3573":"I'm partial to ferrets because of how curious and social they can be if given proper attention.","3574":"Pigs make great pets too!

I'm really sick of this weather.","3582":"Me too. It's just too hot and humid!","3583":"I don't mind the heat, but it definitely makes it harder to get out and about.","3584":"Agreed. I'm hoping for cooler temperatures soon.","3585":"Maybe we should all do a rain dance together?","3586":"Haha that sounds like fun! Let's do it!","3587":" \"Definitely!

Why did you choose a hamster as your pet?","3600":"I think that's great - it must be really rewarding to bond with your pet like that!","3601":"For sure! Dogs are also very easy to take care of which is why I chose one as my pet.","3602":"Exactly - plus, I find them super interesting because of their intelligence and curiosity. That's why I fell in love with mine!","3603":"That makes sense. Goldfish are also quite intelligent creatures and can form bonds with their owners.","3604":"Wow, that's awesome! What do you enjoy most about having a goldfish as your pet?","3605":" \"I agree - it's amazing how unique each animal can be in terms of behaviour and personality. It really makes for an enjoyable experience when taking care of them.\"","3606":" \"Yeah, definitely. Hamsters are also quite low maintenance which was another reason why I chose one as my pet.\"","3607":" \"That's true! The thing I like most about having a goldfish is watching its colours change over time. It almost looks like they have moods sometimes!\"","3608":" \"Wow, that sounds incredible! What kind of activities do you do together?\"","3609":" \"I usually take mine for walks or just hang out together on the couch.

The characters were so funny and the plot twists kept me guessing.","3643":"I was a huge fan of Powerpuff Girls! Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were always getting into crazy adventures.","3644":"Are we talking live-action or animated shows? Because if it's the former I would say Saved by the Bell was great!","3645":"That show was such a classic. Even now I can't help but sing along to the theme song when it plays on tv!","3646":"I'm more of an animated show fan myself. Spongebob Squarepants was one of my favourites growing up.","3647":"Totally agree with you there! Patrick Star and Squidward Tentacles were comedy gold.","3648":"When it comes to nostalgia nothing beats Tom & Jerry for me. It's such an iconic show that still stands the test of time!","3649":"Yup, those two crazy cats never fail to make me laugh. I also really enjoyed The Wild Thornberrys when I was younger.","3650":"Ah yes The Wild Thornberrys - that show had some amazing storylines and taught me so much about wildlife too!","3651":"I can relate - I loved watching Arthur.

I also enjoyed watching Dexter's Laboratory growing up.","3654":"Me too! Dexter was always inventing something new, plus that catchy theme song will stay with me forever!","3655":"Yep same here - another one I watched religiously as a kid was Recess. Such a classic series with some really nice characters.","3656":"Oh absolutely - Mikey Blumberg, Gus Griswald and Spinelli were all such likable characters. And let's not forget Randall Weems...","3657":" \"Haha yeah Randall Weems was pure comic relief! Have any of you watched Doug? That show had some pretty interesting storylines\"","3658":" \"Definitely Doug - Skeeter Valentine and Patti Mayonnaise were my favourite characters though. What about Rocko's Modern Life?\"","3659":" \"Ah yes Rocko's Modern Life - another Nickelodeon classic that never fails to bring back fond memories from my childhood!\"","3660":" \"Can't forget about CatDog either - that show had some really unique humour which made it stand out from other cartoons\"","3661":" \"Agreed! My personal favourite though has got to be Hey Dude. It had this perfect balance between comedy and drama which kept us hooked until the end\"","3662":" \"Absolutely! Hey Dude had some really great episodes. What about As Told By Ginger? That one meant a lot to me growing up\"","3663":" \"Oh yeah As Told By Ginger definitely takes me back too.

Anyone else watch Animaniacs?\"","3665":" \"Animaniacs for sure - Wakko Warner singing 'Yakko's World' will be with us forever haha. What about Rocket Power?\"","3666":" \"Rocket Power is one of those shows where you can just tell how much heart went into creating each episode.

They're so independent and don't need as much attention.","3675":"I'm a big fan of rabbits! They're so cute and cuddly!","3676":"I have to agree with User 3 - rabbits are the cutest. Plus, they can be litter trained!","3677":"My favourite pet is a horse. There's something about their intelligence and beauty that's just mesmerizing.","3678":"Fish are great too! They don't require much maintenance and you can watch them swim around in their tank all day long.","3679":"I'm more of a bird person - I love how they can fly and make sounds.

Watching them run in their wheel is the best entertainment ever.","3683":"My absolute favourite pet is a turtle - they're slow but cute, plus you get to watch them grow from tiny babies into big adults!","3684":"I'm feeling so nostalgic today thinking about all the shows I used to watch as a kid!","3685":"Same here! I can't believe how much TV has changed since then.","3686":"It's such a shame that all the old shows have been forgotten. What were some of your favourites?","3687":"Oh man, there are too many to name! But I especially loved Hey Arnold and Rugrats.","3688":"Ah, good old 90s Nickelodeon. Those cartoons were the best!","3689":"Agreed! Any other shows you remember fondly?","3690":"I was really into Pok\u00e9mon and Digimon when I was younger.

I love taking my pup on walks around the park.","3700":"That sounds like a lot of fun! My hamster loves exploring her cage every day.","3701":"It's true - hamsters make great pets as they don't take up much space either.","3702":"Cats are also low maintenance and can amuse themselves most of the time.","3703":"Dogs need regular exercise but that's part of why I love them so much!","3704":"My pup loves playing fetch with me in the backyard. It's a great bonding activity!","3705":"That's wonderful! Hamsters also love to explore their environment with toys and tunnels.","3706":"Yes, it's really entertaining to watch them play around. So sweet!","3707":"Cats can be very entertaining too. Mine loves chasing after balls of yarn!","3708":"Oh wow, that must be fun to watch too! Dogs tend to like running around more than cats though.","3709":"Absolutely! My dog loves running around in wide open spaces especially.","3710":"Hamsters also enjoy running around in their wheels whenever they get the chance.","3711":"Yes, it's amazing how quickly they can get going sometimes! So entertaining to watch.","3712":" \"Cats have lots of different funny quirks as well - mine loves sleeping in weird positions sometimes!\"","3713":" \"Haha yes, animals are always full of surprises aren't they? Dogs usually just want belly rubs though\"","3714":" \"Yeah definitely! I'm sure all our pets bring us joy in different ways\"","3715":" \"Definitely - animals really do make life better don't they?\"","3716":" \"For sure.

It's been a struggle!","3725":"It looks like it's going to rain soon though.","3726":"That would be great! I could use some relief from the heat.","3727":"Me too, but I'm worried about landslides and flooding if the rain is too heavy.","3728":"We should definitely keep an eye on the news for updates on this weather pattern.","3729":"Yes! Do you think it might cool down after it rains?","3730":"It should help a little, but unfortunately we're still in for a hot summer ahead of us.","3731":"Ugh, that's not what I wanted to hear...","3732":"Maybe we can try to find ways to stay cool during the hottest days?","3733":"Definitely! Maybe putting up some shade or investing in an inflatable pool?","3734":"Cool idea! Anything else people can do to beat the heat?","3735":"I heard that keeping your curtains closed during the day helps keep your house cooler!","3736":"That's true - also leaving bowls of ice around helps as well!","3737":" \"Those are great tips - anything else anyone knows of?\"","3738":" \"Try not to go outside too much during the peak daylight hours. That always makes it worse for me.\"","3739":" \"Yeah, and make sure you drink plenty of water - that'll help keep you cool too.\"","3740":" \"What about using fans? Does anyone know if those work better than ACs?\"","3741":" \"Fans definitely help circulate air and might be cheaper than getting an AC unit installed. However, they won't actually lower the temperature of a room.\"","3742":" \"Ah okay. Thanks for clarifying - good thing I already have an AC unit then!\"","3743":" \"Haha yeah same here. Any other advice on dealing with this heatwave everyone? Let's brainstorm!\"","3744":" \"Maybe eating cold foods like ice cream and popsicles could help distract from the heat a bit?\"","3745":" \"That sounds like a great plan! Who else has any ideas to add?\"","3746":"My favourite pet is a dog. I love that they are loyal and always up for cuddles!","3747":"I totally agree! Cats are my favourite too - they're so independent and can be so entertaining.","3748":"Does anyone else miss the TV programmes from when we were kids?","3749":"Absolutely!

Let's keep our fingers crossed.","3989":"Any chance of thunderstorms too?","3990":"The forecast doesn't show any storms at this time. But you never know!","3991":"I heard there might be a heat wave coming up soon. Ugh!","3992":"Oh no! That would be terrible. Hopefully not!","3993":"We should just enjoy the cooler weather while we can and take advantage of it!","3994":"Yes, let's make sure to get out and enjoy nature before it gets too hot again!","3995":"Agreed! Maybe going swimming would be fun too :)","3996":"Definitely! That sounds like a great idea.","3997":"My favourite pet is a dog because they are always so loyal and loving!","3998":"I love cats the best - they are independent but still affectionate.","3999":"I'm partial to fish! They're easy to take care of and I love watching them swim around in their tank.","4000":"That's true. Fish can be really calming to watch.","4001":"My favourite pet is a rabbit. They're so cute and cuddly!","4002":"That's true! Rabbits are also really smart too.","4003":"Yeah, cats are pretty intelligent as well. Plus I love how they always keep me company when I'm home alone.","4004":"Dogs can be pretty smart too and they make great companions for walks and hikes!","4005":"Absolutely! My rabbit loves running around the yard with me too.","4006":"Awww that sounds adorable!","4007":"It definitely does! Pets bring so much joy into our lives.","4008":"My favourite pet is a dog! I love the way they're so loyal and always there for you.","4009":"I totally agree! Dogs are definitely the best pet. Plus, they're so much fun to be around!","4010":"I'm more of a cat person myself. They're independent and still loving when they want to be.","4011":"That's true too! Cats can also be really funny and playful when they get going.","4012":"My favourite pet is a rabbit. They're so cute and cuddly and make great companions!","4013":"Rabbits are great pets too! And so much easier to take care of than other animals like dogs or cats.","4014":"Yeah, rabbits don't need as much attention or space as dogs or cats do, but they still make great companions!","4015":"I'm a big fan of fish! They're low maintenance and come in all kinds of colors and shapes which makes them really interesting to look at.","4016":"Fish can be really relaxing to watch too. There's something calming about the way they just swim around in the tank all day.","4017":"Totally! Watching fish can be really therapeutic after a long day.","4018":" \"I think reptiles can make good pets as well. Snakes are actually quite intelligent creatures with their own personalities!\"","4019":" \"Reptiles can be really fascinating to observe too. I had a gecko once who was always running around his tank exploring new things!\"","4020":" \"That sounds like an interesting pet! I've never considered reptiles before but maybe I should give it a try sometime.\"","4021":" \"Definitely worth considering if you have the time and space for it. It's definitely a unique experience having a reptile as your pet!\"","4022":" \"Agreed! Having different kinds of pets gives you an appreciation for how diverse nature can be.\"","4023":"It's been really hot the past few days!","4024":"I know! I'm so glad I have air conditioning.","4025":"I don't have air conditioning. It's been a struggle!","4026":"It looks like it's going to rain soon though.","4027":"That would be great! I could use some relief from the heat.","4028":"Me too, but I'm worried about landslides and flooding if the rain is too heavy.","4029":"We should definitely keep an eye on the news for updates on this weather pattern.","4030":"Yes! Do you think it might cool down after it rains?","4031":"It should help a little, but unfortunately we're still in for a hot summer ahead of us.","4032":"Ugh, that's not what I wanted to hear...","4033":"Maybe we can try to find ways to stay cool during the hottest days?","4034":"Definitely! Maybe putting up some shade or investing in an inflatable pool?","4035":"Cool idea! Anything else people can do to beat the heat?","4036":"I heard that keeping your curtains closed during the day helps keep your house cooler!","4037":"That's true - also leaving bowls of ice around helps as well!","4038":" \"Those are great tips - anything else anyone knows of?\"","4039":" \"Try not to go outside too much during the peak daylight hours. That always makes it worse for me.\"","4040":" \"Yeah, and make sure you drink plenty of water - that'll help keep you cool too.\"","4041":" \"What about using fans? Does anyone know if those work better than ACs?\"","4042":" \"Fans definitely help circulate air and might be cheaper than getting an AC unit installed. However, they won't actually lower the temperature of a room.\"","4043":" \"Ah okay. Thanks for clarifying - good thing I already have an AC unit then!\"","4044":" \"Haha yeah same here. Any other advice on dealing with this heatwave everyone? Let's brainstorm!\"","4045":" \"Maybe eating cold foods like ice cream and popsicles could help distract from the heat a bit?\"","4046":" \"That sounds like a great plan! Who else has any ideas to add?\"","4047":"What was your favorite children's TV programme growing up?","4048":"I loved the original Thundercats!","4049":"Muppet Babies was my jam!","4050":"Count Duckula! That show was hilarious.","4051":"Oh man, I used to love watching DuckTales!","4052":"I used to stay up late for Are You Afraid of the Dark?","4053":"Ooh, that was so spooky! I also loved Hey Arnold!","4054":"Ah yes! Hey Arnold was great. I used to love the episodes with Grandpa Phil.","4055":"Recess was one of my favorites too. It had such a great cast of characters.","4056":"Oh gosh, definitely Rugrats. That show never gets old.","4057":"It's amazing how many beloved shows there were in that era!","4058":"It's so hot out today!","4059":"I know, right? I'm trying to stay cool inside.","4060":"It's definitely not the kind of weather for going outside.","4061":"The forecast said it's supposed to be this way all week.","4062":"Ugh, hopefully it will cool down soon!","4063":"I heard some thunder earlier. Could there be rain coming?","4064":"That would be nice. We need some relief from this heatwave.","4065":"Yeah, I'd love a break from the humidity too.","4066":"I heard that the temperature is dropping further south though.","4067":"Maybe we'll get lucky and the wind will bring cooler air our way!","4068":"Fingers crossed! I can't wait for it to cool off around here...","4069":"Me too. I'm so over this heat and humidity already!","4070":"I think it's time for me to invest in an air conditioner...","4071":" \"Definitely! It looks like we may need one for a while yet.\"","4072":" \"Good idea. I think I'm gonna have to do the same thing here...\"","4073":"It's been really hot the past few days!","4074":"I know! I'm so glad I have air conditioning.","4075":"I don't have air conditioning. It's been a struggle!","4076":"It looks like it's going to rain soon though.","4077":"That would be great!

Who else has any ideas to add?\"","4097":"I'm feeling so nostalgic today for children's television programmes! Who else remembers the good old days?","4098":"I definitely do! I especially loved cartoons like Tom and Jerry and Scooby Doo!","4099":"Oh wow, those bring back so many memories! I used to love shows like Arthur and The Magic School Bus.","4100":"Ah, yes! Those were the best. What about you User4? What are some of your favorite shows?","4101":"I was always a huge fan of Hey Arnold!, Rugrats and Recess. What about you User5?","4102":"I remember watching Wishbone, Are You Afraid of the Dark? And Animaniacs. They were all great shows!","4103":"Animaniacs was one of my favorites too! I also loved Reading Rainbow and Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.","4104":"Oh yes, those were so special. I have fond memories of watching Sesame Street as well.","4105":"That brings back even more memories! I remember watching Dragon Tales when I was younger.","4106":"Dragon Tales was such a magical show. My siblings and I would watch it together all the time!","4107":"It's amazing how quickly childhood passes by. It feels like just yesterday we were watching all these shows together!","4108":"It sure does. But at least we can still look back on them fondly :)","4109":"My favourite pet is a cat. They're so cuddly and loving!","4110":"My favourite pet is a dog. They're so loyal and always happy to see you!","4111":"I love rabbits!

They're really cool looking and they don't need as much care as other pets.","4115":"For me it's turtles all the way! I love how slow and relaxed they are, plus they live a long time too!","4116":"I'm partial to hamsters. They're small and easy to care for, plus they make cute little noises when you hold them.","4117":"Birds are my go-to! They have such beautiful songs that cheer me up every day.","4118":"Hedgehogs are awesome! I love how prickly they can be but still cute at the same time.","4119":"Ferrets are definitely my favourite pet.

That show was so much fun!","4122":"It definitely brought science to life for me.","4123":"Does anyone remember 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?' It was so creepy but so good!","4124":"Ah yes! I couldn't watch it alone though because it scared me too much!","4125":"Hey everyone! I still love watching 'Rugrats' reruns. They always make me laugh!\"","4126":"Yes! And 'Doug' was also a great show. It's been too long since I've seen it!","4127":"Wow, I haven't thought about those shows in forever. Nostalgia is strong today!","4128":"It really is! Does anyone else remember Recess\"? It's one of my all-time favorites.\"","4129":"Of course! I still quote characters from that show all the time.","4130":"I'm loving this conversation right now.

Anyone else agree?\"","4140":" \"Yes! Arthur was always teaching us valuable lessons!\"","4141":" \"What about 'Sister Sister'? That show had some amazing episodes!\"","4142":" \"Totally agree! So many classics from the 90s and early 2000s.\"","4143":" \"Agreed. We should put together a list of our favorite old shows soon!\"","4144":" \"'The Adventures of Pete & Pete' has to make the cut too. Such an underrated gem!\"","4145":" \"'Animaniacs' has to be in there as well. Anyone else think so?\"","4146":" \"'The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo' definitely deserves recognition as well!\"","4147":" \"Absolutely! This has been such a great discussion. Let's keep going :)\"","4148":"Remember watching 'The Magic Roundabout' when we were kids? Such a classic!","4149":"Ah yes! I loved that show. Do you remember 'Rainbow'?","4150":"That's the one with Zippy, George and Bungle right? That was my favorite show growing up.","4151":"Haha yeah! What about 'Postman Pat'? I used to watch that every Saturday morning.","4152":"Oh man, I haven't thought about that in years. Those were the days!","4153":"My favourite pet is a dog because they are loyal and loving companions!","4154":"I love cats too!

They are majestic animals with immense strength and beauty.","4171":" \"That's true, horses are really majestic! I'd also like to add that guinea pigs make great pets as well - they're so gentle and calm.\"","4172":" \"Guinea pigs definitely deserve a shoutout! What about goats? You don't see many people keeping them as pets but they can be really fun too.\"","4173":" \"Goats are awesome! They have such unique personalities. I think it's important to remember that all animals should be treated with respect and kindness regardless of whether we keep them as pets or not.\"","4174":" \"Exactly! We should all strive to understand our furry friends better, no matter the species. Rats are often overlooked as pets but they can actually be quite affectionate too!\"","4175":" \"Rats definitely get a bad rep sometimes, but if you give them lots of love and attention then you'll definitely get it back from them. What about snakes?\"","4176":" \"Snakes can make great pets too if you know how to handle them properly. They can live quite long lives if looked after correctly.\"","4177":" \"Yes, that's true! Besides reptiles, we shouldn't forget about amphibians either - frogs, salamanders, axolotls etc. All have their own charm and personality.\"","4178":" \"Absolutely! Many people don't know this but even invertebrates such as hermit crabs or spiders can make good pets too. It just takes some patience and understanding.\"","4179":" \"Wow that's interesting! You learn something new every day. The same goes for exotic insects like tarantulas or beetles - it may not be everyone's cup of tea but it could still be rewarding for those willing to give it a go!\"","4180":" \"Interesting points everyone. Let\u2019s not forget about farm animals either; goats, cows etc. Although these require more work than other smaller domesticated animals, they offer plenty of joy in return\".","4181":"My favourite pet is a dog because they're so loyal and loving!","4182":"I have to agree with you, dogs are definitely the best pets! I also love cats though because they're so independent.","4183":"I've always been a fan of reptiles! They're fascinating creatures and can be great companions.","4184":"I'm a big fan of hamsters. They're so cute and cuddly, plus they make great low maintenance pets.","4185":"Fish always make for an interesting pet.

I'm looking forward to the warm weather!","4202":"Me too! We've been stuck inside for too long now.","4203":"Yeah, it'll be nice to get out and enjoy some sunshine.","4204":"I can't wait! What are your plans when the weather gets better?","4205":"I'm planning on going camping with my friends. What about you guys?","4206":"I'm thinking of doing some hiking in the woods.

It would be nice if we could get some relief from this heatwave.","4216":"If only there was something we could do to make sure we got cooler temperatures!","4217":"Maybe we should all go outside and dance around in a circle? That always works in cartoons!","4218":"Haha, that would definitely make for an interesting sight! I'd love to try it out.","4219":"I think we should just keep our fingers crossed and hope for cooler temperatures instead!","4220":"Sounds like a plan! Let's keep an eye on the forecast and hopefully get what we're wishing for.","4221":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for the TV shows I used to watch as a kid. What about you guys?","4222":"Definitely! All those old cartoons used to be so much fun.","4223":"I remember I used to watch 'The Magic School Bus' every day after school!","4224":"Oh yeah, that was one of my favorites too! Also, 'Rugrats' was always a classic.","4225":"And let's not forget 'Dragon Tales' and 'Arthur'. Those were such good shows!","4226":"Agreed! It's amazing how quickly time goes by. We're all grown up now!","4227":"Haha, totally! Nowadays it's all about streaming services and Netflix.","4228":"Yeah but nothing beats the old-fashioned charm of those classic shows.","4229":"True - did anyone else here watch 'Hey Arnold!'?","4230":"Yup, definitely - with Helga and Gerald? Classic stuff!","4231":"Yep! All the jokes in that show were hilarious... can't believe how much I miss it now!","4232":"Exactly - it feels like just yesterday we were watching them on TV. Ahh nostalgia...","4233":"I know right? And what about 'Courage The Cowardly Dog'? That one had me jumping out of my seat every time!","4234":"Hahaha yeah same here! That show had some scary moments but it was still lots of fun.","4235":"For sure! And don't forget 'Catdog'. Who remembers those two?","4236":"Ahh yes Catdog was great too. The contrast between their personalities made it so funny.","4237":"Totally agree - I think we should start a petition for these shows to come back on air again haha","4238":" \"Ha wouldn't that be something?! But even if they don't bring them back, at least we have our memories from when we were kids :)\"","4239":" \"You said it! Even though times are different now, these shows will forever stay in our hearts.\"","4240":" \"Aww that's so sweet :) Okay everyone let's keep sharing our favorite childhood programs.

Let's keep talking about them this way we'll never forget them :)\"","4243":"It's been really hot the past few days!","4244":"I know! I'm so glad I have air conditioning.","4245":"I don't have air conditioning. It's been a struggle!","4246":"It looks like it's going to rain soon though.","4247":"That would be great! I could use some relief from the heat.","4248":"Me too, but I'm worried about landslides and flooding if the rain is too heavy.","4249":"We should definitely keep an eye on the news for updates on this weather pattern.","4250":"Yes! Do you think it might cool down after it rains?","4251":"It should help a little, but unfortunately we're still in for a hot summer ahead of us.","4252":"Ugh, that's not what I wanted to hear...","4253":"Maybe we can try to find ways to stay cool during the hottest days?","4254":"Definitely! Maybe putting up some shade or investing in an inflatable pool?","4255":"Cool idea! Anything else people can do to beat the heat?","4256":"I heard that keeping your curtains closed during the day helps keep your house cooler!","4257":"That's true - also leaving bowls of ice around helps as well!","4258":" \"Those are great tips - anything else anyone knows of?\"","4259":" \"Try not to go outside too much during the peak daylight hours.

Who else has any ideas to add?\"","4267":"I'm feeling so nostalgic for all the kids TV shows I used to watch!","4268":"Me too! What was your favorite one?","4269":"My favorite was definitely 'The Magic School Bus' - it had such a fun adventure feel to it!","4270":"Oh my gosh yes!

Doug always had trouble fitting in but he never gave up trying.","4279":"I remember 'Rugrats' too. It was one of my favorite shows as a kid.","4280":"That's true! Tommy and the gang were always getting themselves into funny predicaments.","4281":"And let's not forget about 'Hey Arnold!' That show taught us all life lessons through Arnold's adventures.","4282":"Absolutely! It was such an inspiring show for kids. We could all learn something from it.","4283":"Indeed we can! I think these old shows still hold important messages that are relevant today.","4284":"I'm so nostalgic for the old children's TV programmes I used to watch when I was a kid!","4285":"Me too!

They definitely made the show more interesting!","4297":"One of my favorites was Rocko's Modern Life. There were so many unique characters and gags that kept me entertained for hours on end!","4298":"No doubt about it!

I think it's important to remember that all animals should be treated with respect and kindness regardless of whether we keep them as pets or not.\"","4477":" \"Exactly! We should all strive to understand our furry friends better, no matter the species. Rats are often overlooked as pets but they can actually be quite affectionate too!\"","4478":" \"Rats definitely get a bad rep sometimes, but if you give them lots of love and attention then you'll definitely get it back from them.

Many people don't know this but even invertebrates such as hermit crabs or spiders can make good pets too. It just takes some patience and understanding.\"","4482":" \"Wow that's interesting! You learn something new every day.

It's weird how even though they're so old now they still bring back such vivid memories.","4549":"It's amazing how these shows have stood the test of time. Seeing them as an adult is a completely different experience too.","4550":"Agreed! Even though there are plenty of new kids TV shows out there, nothing compares to the nostalgia of watching these classic cartoons.","4551":"That's true. It's nice to have something from your childhood that you can share with your own children now.","4552":"Exactly! There's just something about these old shows that will never be replicated in modern television.","4553":"Absolutely!

So sweet!","6681":"Cats can be very entertaining too. Mine loves chasing after balls of yarn!","6682":"Oh wow, that must be fun to watch too! Dogs tend to like running around more than cats though.","6683":"Absolutely! My dog loves running around in wide open spaces especially.","6684":"Hamsters also enjoy running around in their wheels whenever they get the chance.","6685":"Yes, it's amazing how quickly they can get going sometimes! So entertaining to watch.","6686":" \"Cats have lots of different funny quirks as well - mine loves sleeping in weird positions sometimes!\"","6687":" \"Haha yes, animals are always full of surprises aren't they? Dogs usually just want belly rubs though\"","6688":" \"Yeah definitely! I'm sure all our pets bring us joy in different ways\"","6689":" \"Definitely - animals really do make life better don't they?\"","6690":" \"For sure.

They are so loyal and loving!","6693":"I totally agree!

What do you think of the weather lately?","6717":"I'm loving it! The sun is out and it's so pleasant.","6718":"Yeah, I've been enjoying the nice weather too. It's great to be able to get outside and enjoy it.","6719":"Definitely! The heat can be a bit unbearable at times though.","6720":"True that. But I don't mind too much as long as I have the air conditioning!","6721":"Ha ha! Yeah that's true. I guess we just have to make the most of it while we can!","6722":"It's so hot outside today!","6723":"I know, it's been like this for the past few days.","6724":"Yeah, I'm starting to worry about the drought this summer.","6725":"It doesn't look good right now. We need some rain soon!","6726":"I hope it starts raining soon! I'm ready for some cooler weather.","6727":"It's supposed to cool down a bit later in the week. Let's keep our fingers crossed.","6728":"Any chance of thunderstorms too?","6729":"The forecast doesn't show any storms at this time. But you never know!","6730":"I heard there might be a heat wave coming up soon. Ugh!","6731":"Oh no! That would be terrible. Hopefully not!","6732":"We should just enjoy the cooler weather while we can and take advantage of it!","6733":"Yes, let's make sure to get out and enjoy nature before it gets too hot again!","6734":"Agreed! Maybe going swimming would be fun too :)","6735":"Definitely! That sounds like a great idea.","6736":"It sure is hot out today!","6737":"I know - it's been a scorcher all week!","6738":"I'm so glad I have air conditioning.","6739":"Me too. I don't think I could take this heat much longer.","6740":"I heard that next week will be cooler.","6741":"That would be great! It'll be a nice break from the heat.","6742":"But don't forget to keep an eye on the forecast. It might change.","6743":"Good point. I always like to keep up with the weather for planning purposes.","6744":"It's so unpredictable here - one day it can be hot, and the next day it could rain!","6745":"That's true. We get a lot of storms in this area.","6746":"It's just part of living in a tropical climate, I guess!","6747":"Yeah, but at least we get some relief from the heat when it rains!","6748":"Exactly! Nothing beats a cool summer shower after a long day in the sun.","6749":"So true. Plus, there's nothing quite like the sound of thunderstorms in the distance.","6750":"Agreed!

I can't wait to get out and enjoy the sunshine!","6765":"Me too! I hear they're calling for rain on Sunday, though.","6766":"I hope not! We need some sun after all this rain we've been having.","6767":"It looks like that's still up in the air. The forecast is changing every day.","6768":"Well, at least the temperature should stay pretty comfortable no matter what happens with the rain!","6769":"For sure. It'll be nice to have a break from all this cold weather we've been having lately.","6770":"Agreed! I'm ready for springtime already.","6771":"Me too.

I remember watching Arthur religiously when I was younger.","6782":"I used to love Arthur too! Do you remember Courage the Cowardly Dog?","6783":"Of course!

Does anyone else have any childhood TV favourites?","6785":"Yup, mine was definitely Hey Arnold!","6786":"Ooh yeah, I loved Hey Arnold too! And who could forget Rugrats?","6787":"Definitely.

They're so fluffy and cuddly!","6808":"I prefer lizards because they look so cool!","6809":"My favourite pet would have to be birds - I just love hearing them chirp in the morning!","6810":"I like turtles for their longevity - some can live up to 80 years old!","6811":"Ferrets are amazing too - they're very intelligent and curious creatures.","6812":"Horses are my go-to. They are majestic animals with immense strength and beauty.","6813":" \"That's true, horses are really majestic! I'd also like to add that guinea pigs make great pets as well - they're so gentle and calm.\"","6814":" \"Guinea pigs definitely deserve a shoutout! What about goats? You don't see many people keeping them as pets but they can be really fun too.\"","6815":" \"Goats are awesome! They have such unique personalities. I think it's important to remember that all animals should be treated with respect and kindness regardless of whether we keep them as pets or not.\"","6816":" \"Exactly! We should all strive to understand our furry friends better, no matter the species. Rats are often overlooked as pets but they can actually be quite affectionate too!\"","6817":" \"Rats definitely get a bad rep sometimes, but if you give them lots of love and attention then you'll definitely get it back from them. What about snakes?\"","6818":" \"Snakes can make great pets too if you know how to handle them properly. They can live quite long lives if looked after correctly.\"","6819":" \"Yes, that's true! Besides reptiles, we shouldn't forget about amphibians either - frogs, salamanders, axolotls etc. All have their own charm and personality.\"","6820":" \"Absolutely! Many people don't know this but even invertebrates such as hermit crabs or spiders can make good pets too. It just takes some patience and understanding.\"","6821":" \"Wow that's interesting! You learn something new every day. The same goes for exotic insects like tarantulas or beetles - it may not be everyone's cup of tea but it could still be rewarding for those willing to give it a go!\"","6822":" \"Interesting points everyone. Let\u2019s not forget about farm animals either; goats, cows etc. Although these require more work than other smaller domesticated animals, they offer plenty of joy in return\".","6823":"I love cats! They're so independent and yet so loving. Plus each one has such a unique personality!","6824":"Dogs are my favorite! They're always so excited to see me when I come home. I have a Labrador Retriever who's just the best.","6825":"I'm more of a bird person myself. They are so beautiful and intelligent, plus they can provide great companionship.","6826":"Fish are my favorite pet.

Do you remember the music for the opening credits?","6844":"Yes! It's so iconic. Is there any other show you miss?","6845":"Totally! Cardcaptor Sakura is such a classic. I still have all the manga in my bookshelf.","6846":"That's awesome. What was your favorite episode of Cardcaptor Sakura?","6847":"It's hard to pick just one, but I think my favorite episode is when Sakura captures The Moon card.","6848":"That's a great one! I always loved watching how she would capture each card with a different strategy.","6849":"It's so hot today! I'm already sweating.","6850":"I know, right? It's been like this all week.","6851":"It's too hot to do anything outside in this heat!","6852":"Agreed.

Some cooler air would be welcome right now!","6864":"Do you think there will be any flooding?","6865":" \"It depends on how much rain falls and how fast. Hopefully not though!\"","6866":" \"It looks like most of the storm should move through quickly though, so hopefully that helps minimize any potential flooding issues\"","6867":" \"That's true.

In any case, I'm looking forward to some relief from this heat wave soon\"","6869":"It's really hot outside today!","6870":"I know! I'm already sweating just by looking at the thermometer.","6871":"Does anyone know when this heat wave will end?","6872":"There's no way to tell, but hopefully it won't last much longer!","6873":"I heard that there's a chance of rain in the forecast for tomorrow.","6874":"That would be great - I can't take this heat any longer!","6875":"Rain or shine, I'm looking forward to getting out and enjoying the weekend!","6876":"Me too!

And don't forget about goats either - they're very friendly animals that love attention from humans.","8114":"My favorite pet would definitely have to be dogs though - there's nothing quite like the bond you have with your pup!","8115":"Agreed! Dogs are definitely the best when it comes to building relationships with humans. Plus, they understand us in ways other animals don't!","8116":"I prefer cats myself because of their independence - they don't need constant attention or supervision like some other pets do.","8117":"That's true but I also like how cats can still form strong bonds with their owners if given enough time and dedication.","8118":"Don't forget about lizards either - who doesn't want a pet that looks kind of prehistoric?","8119":"Fish can also make great pets if you're looking for something low maintenance.

I had one when I was younger as well. It was really fun to watch it run around the cage.","8965":"I've heard that guinea pigs make good pets too. They're quite social animals so they need lots of attention though!","8966":"Guinea pigs can be very sweet if you give them enough time and care. It's important to research the breed before getting one though!","8967":"Absolutely! All pets need lots of love and attention in order to thrive.","8968":"That's so true.

Enjoy!","8988":"It's so hot outside today!","8989":"I know! I'm so glad I have air conditioning though.","8990":"Me too! I don't know how people survived before air conditioning.","8991":"It's so hot out today!","8992":"I know, it's been like this all week.","8993":"I'm glad I don't have to go outside!","8994":"Me too. I'm just staying inside and keeping cool.","8995":"Is anyone else having trouble sleeping in this heat?","8996":"Yes!

I always wanted one growing up.","9071":"My favorite pet is a hamster. They're so tiny and adorable!","9072":"Hamsters are great pets too! I used to have one when I was younger.","9073":"I like reptiles best. Lizards, snakes and turtles can all make great pets if you know how to take care of them properly.","9074":"Totally agree! Reptiles are fascinating creatures with unique personalities.","9075":"Fish make the best pets in my opinion. Watching them swim around in their tank is peaceful and calming.","9076":"I don't think any other pet can beat the classic goldfish. They bring so much joy with their bright colors!","9077":"Goldfish are certainly underrated as pets. Plus they're easy to look after which makes them perfect for busy people!","9078":"I'm an animal lover but my favorite pet has got to be birds. Parakeets, cockatiels and parrots all have such wonderful personalities!","9079":" \"Birds can be very entertaining as well as being beautiful creatures. Plus they provide excellent companionship too!\"","9080":" \"That's true! My grandmother always had birds around her house when I was growing up.\"","9081":" \"What about other small mammals like ferrets or chinchillas?

And of course don't forget about gerbils - they may not be as popular as some other animals but they can still make wonderful companions\"","9088":" \"Gerbils are definitely underrated when it comes to pets - they are actually quite social creatures that enjoy playing with each other\"","9089":"Another interesting option for a pet is an amphibian like frogs or salamanders - these animals can bring hours of entertainment with their antics!\"","9090":"","9091":"It's so hot outside! I'm melting!","9092":"I know right? And I'm stuck inside all day.","9093":"Did you hear that a cold front is moving in?","9094":"Really? That would be great!","9095":"Yes - it's supposed to bring some much needed relief from the heat.","9096":"I can't wait. I'm sick of this heat wave!","9097":"Me too. Some cooler weather would be nice.","9098":"Maybe we'll get some rain too!","9099":"That would be awesome - wash away the summer heat and make way for fall!","9100":"I'm so nostalgic for the old children's TV programmes I used to watch when I was a kid!","9101":"Me too!

He was always up to something funny and there were lots of lessons learned in each episode.","9111":"That's true! Plus, he had some really cool friends like Skeeter and Patti Mayonnaise.","9112":"Ahh yes, I remember those two very well. They definitely made the show more interesting!","9113":"One of my favorites was Rocko's Modern Life. There were so many unique characters and gags that kept me entertained for hours on end!","9114":"No doubt about it! I always thought Rocko himself was really funny and his best friend Heffer cracked me up every time!","9115":"Don't forget about CatDog either. That show always made me laugh out loud with its wacky antics!","9116":"Agreed! And who could forget the rivalries between Cat and Dog? Those moments were hilarious!","9117":"It's so hot outside! I'm sweating just walking to my car.","9118":"I hear you - it's been scorching here too. Is there any relief in sight?","9119":"Not that I can see. Even the trees seem to be wilting!","9120":"Maybe a storm will come soon and cool things off a bit.","9121":"That would be nice, but I think we have weeks of this heat left yet.","9122":"Let's hope for some thunderstorms at least!","9123":"Agreed.

It's too bad they don't make shows like these anymore!","9152":"Agreed, but it's nice to have all these memories to look back on fondly.","9153":"True, there's nothing quite like the nostalgia of childhood TV programmes.","9154":"Does anyone else miss Arthur or Sesame Street?","9155":"Yes definitely! Those two were such great shows for kids.","9156":"Agreed. I also used to watch Rocket Power which I think is underrated.","9157":"Rocket Power was awesome!

I'm looking forward to a break from the heat.","9243":"Does anyone know if it's going to cool off soon?","9244":"I heard that there might be rain later this week that could help cool things down.","9245":"That would be great! Fingers crossed!","9246":"Yes, I hope so too. What do you think the temperature will be like over the weekend?","9247":"I think it might stay pretty warm but hopefully not as hot as it has been lately.","9248":"Agreed. It would be nice if we could get some relief from this heatwave.","9249":"If only there was something we could do to make sure we got cooler temperatures!","9250":"Maybe we should all go outside and dance around in a circle?

I'd love to try it out.","9252":"I think we should just keep our fingers crossed and hope for cooler temperatures instead!","9253":"Sounds like a plan!

Also had a soft spot for Tiny Toon Adventures.","9269":"Tiny Toons are iconic. There's also Gargoyles which was an awesome show as well.","9270":"Truth be told, nothing beats the classic cartoons from our childhoods like Scooby Doo.","9271":" \"Scooby Doo was always so much fun to watch. Can't forget that era of classic cartoons!\"","9272":" \"And let us not forget the amazingness that was The Real Ghostbusters!\"","9273":" \"Oh man, The Real Ghostbusters were absolutely fantastic! So many great memories...\"","9274":" \"We're really lucky to have grown up with such wonderful programs on TV. They will never be forgotten!\"","9275":"It's been so hot lately!","9276":"I know!

Which one stands out as your favourite?","9285":"That's a tough choice. But if I had to pick one, it would be 'Doug'. It was just so unique and imaginative!","9286":"I totally get that. My favourite was always 'The Wild Thornberrys'. Who else misses those guys?","9287":"Definitely me! That show was super cool.","9288":"It sure was! They even made a movie about them - did anyone see it?","9289":"I did! It was awesome. But nothing beats the original series.","9290":"Agreed.

Watching them swim around in their tank is peaceful and calming.","9307":"I don't think any other pet can beat the classic goldfish. They bring so much joy with their bright colors!","9308":"Goldfish are certainly underrated as pets. Plus they're easy to look after which makes them perfect for busy people!","9309":"I'm an animal lover but my favorite pet has got to be birds. Parakeets, cockatiels and parrots all have such wonderful personalities!","9310":" \"Birds can be very entertaining as well as being beautiful creatures.

I can't believe how much hotter it's been this summer.","9323":"I know right? It doesn't look like the heatwave is going to end anytime soon.","9324":"Ugh, I'm so over this weather. Does anyone know of any cool places to escape the heat?","9325":"Actually, the temperature has dropped significantly up north. That might be a good place to go!","9326":"Yeah, it's definitely still hot here in the city but not as bad as before.

That show had such a great sense of humor.","9335":"What's the weather like today?","9336":"It's sunny and really hot!","9337":"That sounds great! I'm looking forward to spending some time outside.","9338":"I heard there's going to be a thunderstorm later this afternoon.","9339":"Really? That's not what the forecast said this morning.","9340":"It's always best to check the radar and prepare for the worst!","9341":"Good advice! So what should we do if it does rain?","9342":"I guess make sure you have an umbrella handy!","9343":"Good idea.

Also can't forget about Rocko's Modern Life.\"","9358":" \"Absolutely - that show had such a unique style to it. Don't forget about CatDog either!\"","9359":" \"Agreed - and let's not forget about As Told By Ginger or The Wild Thornberrys as well!\"","9360":" \"Yeah, those two were really fun shows too.

Just make sure they have a warm spot to bask in, plenty of food and water, and that their enclosure is secure!","9368":"Fish are my favorite pet.

It's been a lifesaver this summer.","10269":"I hope the weather cools down soon. I'm so ready for fall to start.","10270":"It's definitely been an unusually warm season this year.","10271":"That's for sure! Especially here in the south where it tends to be hot anyway.","10272":"Maybe we'll get lucky and have an early frost soon that will help cool things off a bit.","10273":"I've been keeping an eye on the forecast and it looks like temperatures should drop soon.","10274":"That would be great! I'm just trying to keep cool until then.","10275":"Same here.

That movie never gets old for me!","10288":"Scooby-Doo is a childhood classic. Who doesn't love solving mysteries with Scooby and the gang?","10289":"I still catch myself singing along to old episodes of The Electric Company!","10290":"Yes! I remember watching that too! That show taught me how to read.","10291":"Courage the Cowardly Dog was one of my favorites. It was filled with spooky secrets and creepy creatures.","10292":"I watched Tiny Toon Adventures all the time when I was younger! Montana Max is still one of my favorite villains ever.","10293":"Oh man, Animaniacs! Yakko, Wakko, and Dot were always up to something crazy!","10294":"It's hard not to think about Doug when talking about nostalgia.

We're lucky compared to other parts of the world.","10312":"Indeed! There are places that experience far harsher weather than us.","10313":"Maybe we should be thankful and make the most of what we have here.","10314":"Absolutely!

I'm just glad it's not as humid as it usually is this time of year.","10367":"It sure does feel like summertime!","10368":"Yeah, but at least the nights are still cool enough for sleeping.","10369":"True. That's something to be thankful for at least!","10370":"I heard there might be a thunderstorm later in the day.","10371":"Really? I haven't heard anything about that yet.","10372":"Yeah, the forecast said there was a chance of rain in the afternoon.","10373":"That would be nice! A break from this heat would be great.","10374":"I'm just hoping we don't get any hail or high winds with it!","10375":"Me too, that would make things worse than they already are!","10376":"At least if we get some storms it might help clear out some of the humidity in the air.","10377":"Definitely. Some cooler air would be welcome right now!","10378":"Do you think there will be any flooding?","10379":" \"It depends on how much rain falls and how fast.

I could use some relief from the heat.","10410":"Me too, but I'm worried about landslides and flooding if the rain is too heavy.","10411":"We should definitely keep an eye on the news for updates on this weather pattern.","10412":"Yes! Do you think it might cool down after it rains?","10413":"It should help a little, but unfortunately we're still in for a hot summer ahead of us.","10414":"Ugh, that's not what I wanted to hear...","10415":"Maybe we can try to find ways to stay cool during the hottest days?","10416":"Definitely!

Does anyone know if those work better than ACs?\"","10424":" \"Fans definitely help circulate air and might be cheaper than getting an AC unit installed. However, they won't actually lower the temperature of a room.\"","10425":" \"Ah okay. Thanks for clarifying - good thing I already have an AC unit then!\"","10426":" \"Haha yeah same here. Any other advice on dealing with this heatwave everyone?

Is anyone else feeling it?","10453":"Yeah! My AC is struggling to keep the house cool. What about you?","10454":"Ugh, I'm melting in my office. And I don't think my boss would appreciate me putting on the AC.","10455":"Ventilation? That's a good idea.","10456":"Good call! I'll try that out first before resorting to other measures.","10457":"Let us know how that goes for you!","10458":"Will do. It feels like it's been too hot for too long already...","10459":"I know, right? We need some rain to cool things off!","10460":"That would be great. Do you think it might happen soon?","10461":"Hopefully! Let's keep our fingers crossed.","10462":"It's so cold today, I can't believe it's already winter!","10463":"I know right?

It's amazing how well they adapt to different environments.","11547":"Dogs have been my best friends since childhood - there's nothing quite like coming home after a long day to find them wagging their tails waiting for you!","11548":"Birds are simply amazing creatures - it's hard not to appreciate their beauty as they fly by in the sky or sing sweet melodies in your garden.","11549":"There's something special about having an aquarium full of fish - watching them swim around peacefully is truly calming experience!","11550":" \"For me it has to be horses - riding one has always been an incredibly freeing experience that no other animal can replicate!\"","11551":"My favorite pet is a dog because they are so loyal and loving!","11552":"I'm a cat person myself. They are very independent, yet still affectionate.","11553":"I have to agree with User2!

Especially when you feed them!","11558":"That's true. Watching them swim around can be quite entertaining.","11559":"I also like reptiles. They require more work than other pets but it's worth it in the end!","11560":"I haven't had much experience with reptiles, but I'm sure they are just as rewarding as any other pet!","11561":"Definitely!

They bring so much joy!","11572":"My family has always had cats, so I guess that's why I like them. Plus, they make great companions when you're feeling lonely.","11573":"Reptiles are my thing! They're low-maintenance pets that don't take up too much space.","11574":"Horses are amazing creatures! It's always rewarding spending time with them.","11575":"I recently got a ferret and he's such an active little guy. He loves exploring his cage and playing with his toys.","11576":"Goats are just the best. They're full of personality and their antics never fail to make me laugh!","11577":"My favourite pet is definitely a hedgehog. You can tell how happy they are when they curl up into a ball for you!","11578":"I used to love watching the old Disney cartoons when I was a kid!","11579":"Oh yes, I remember them!

Ahh nostalgia...","11605":"I know right? And what about 'Courage The Cowardly Dog'? That one had me jumping out of my seat every time!","11606":"Hahaha yeah same here! That show had some scary moments but it was still lots of fun.","11607":"For sure! And don't forget 'Catdog'. Who remembers those two?","11608":"Ahh yes Catdog was great too. The contrast between their personalities made it so funny.","11609":"Totally agree - I think we should start a petition for these shows to come back on air again haha","11610":" \"Ha wouldn't that be something?! But even if they don't bring them back, at least we have our memories from when we were kids :)\"","11611":" \"You said it! Even though times are different now, these shows will forever stay in our hearts.\"","11612":" \"Aww that's so sweet :) Okay everyone let's keep sharing our favorite childhood programs. What else do you remember?\"","11613":" \"Let's see... there was also 'Rocket Power', 'Recess', 'Doug' and so many more...\"","11614":" \"Oh wow yeah those were all great ones too! Let's keep talking about them this way we'll never forget them :)\"","11615":"I'm feeling nostalgic for all the cartoons I used to watch when I was a kid!","11616":"Same! I watched Sailor Moon and Digimon every day after school.","11617":"Ahhh, I remember those. What about Pokemon?","11618":"Oh yeah, that was my absolute favorite! Do you remember the music for the opening credits?","11619":"Yes! It's so iconic. Is there any other show you miss?","11620":"Totally! Cardcaptor Sakura is such a classic. I still have all the manga in my bookshelf.","11621":"That's awesome. What was your favorite episode of Cardcaptor Sakura?","11622":"It's hard to pick just one, but I think my favorite episode is when Sakura captures The Moon card.","11623":"That's a great one!

Is anyone else feeling the heat today?","11642":"Yeah, it's really hot out there. I'm sweating buckets!","11643":"It's supposed to be even hotter tomorrow according to the forecast.","11644":"Ugh, I'm dreading it. Does anyone know what the humidity is like?","11645":"It's pretty high right now. Might be a good idea to stay indoors if you can.","11646":"Good point! The heat might be dangerous for some people.","11647":"I heard that thunderstorms are on their way later this week as well.","11648":"Really? That would be nice - could use a bit of a break from all this heat!","11649":"Yes please! I guess we just have to wait and see what happens.","11650":"Yep! Let's hope for rain soon.","11651":"My favorite pet is a cat because they are so affectionate and loyal!","11652":"I love cats too! They're such beautiful creatures.","11653":"I'm more of a dog person. I find that they have so much energy and enthusiasm for life.","11654":"That's true! Dogs are great companions. What kind of dogs do you like?","11655":"I think poodles are pretty awesome. They look so fluffy and cute!","11656":"Haha, yes! I agree. I especially like labradors though, they're super friendly and always up for a game or two.","11657":"Labradors sound fun. I think my favorite thing about cats is their independence though - they always come back home eventually!","11658":"That's true - cats never seem to be too far away from home. That's why I love them!","11659":"I'm feeling so nostalgic right now! I used to love watching The Wiggles when I was a kid!","11660":"Yeah same here! They were my favourite show growing up. What about you User3?","11661":"Oh man, I still remember the theme song from Thomas and Friends. Brings back so many good memories!","11662":"I remember Barney the Dinosaur.

There's just something special about those old-school shows that can't be replaced.","11665":"Absolutely! I also loved Hey Arnold and Rugrats.","11666":"Oh yeah Rugrats was great.

It's too bad they don't make shows like these anymore!","11669":"Agreed, but it's nice to have all these memories to look back on fondly.","11670":"True, there's nothing quite like the nostalgia of childhood TV programmes.","11671":"Does anyone else miss Arthur or Sesame Street?","11672":"Yes definitely! Those two were such great shows for kids.","11673":"Agreed. I also used to watch Rocket Power which I think is underrated.","11674":"Rocket Power was awesome!

My brother and I would always watch it together\"","11678":" \"Wild Thornberrys was great. Don't forget Doug either - that one still makes me smile\"","11679":" \"Ahh yes Doug..so much nostalgia wrapped up into one show! All these childhood TV programmes were truly special\"","11680":"It's been really hot lately, hasn't it?","11681":"Yes! I'm so glad it finally warmed up after all the cold weather we had earlier this year.","11682":"I know! It's such a relief to not have to bundle up every time I go outside.","11683":"It's definitely been a long winter. I can't wait for summer!","11684":"Me too! I'm ready for some fun in the sun!","11685":"I love how much more daylight we get during the summer months.","11686":"Agreed! And all the outdoor activities that come with warmer weather are great too!","11687":"Do you guys think it will stay warm or cool off soon?","11688":"It looks like temperatures will stay pretty steady in the next few weeks.","11689":"That's good news. I don't think my AC can handle any more heat than what we've already had this summer!","11690":"I heard there might be some rain coming our way soon. That should help cool things down a bit.","11691":"That would be nice. We haven't seen rain in a while now.","11692":"Yeah, it definitely seems like it's been dry lately. Fingers crossed for some precipitation soon!","11693":"I hope so too! Rain always makes everything feel a little bit fresher.","11694":"Indeed! Maybe we'll even get a chance to see some lightning and thunder.","11695":"That would be awesome! Nothing beats a good thunderstorm on a hot summer day.","11696":"Amen to that! It just adds something extra special to an already beautiful season.","11697":"It's so hot outside today!","11698":"Yeah, I'm already sweating!","11699":"I heard it might even get up to 90\u00b0F this weekend.","11700":"That's crazy! That's too hot for me.","11701":"Me too. I hope it cools off soon.","11702":"It looks like it will be cloudy tomorrow though, so maybe that'll help?","11703":"I hope so! It's been really dry lately too.","11704":"That's true. We need some rain soon.","11705":"Yes! Some rain would be great for the plants and everything else around here.","11706":"Let's hope we get some soon then!","11707":"I think I heard there might be a storm coming in next week?","11708":"Really? That would be nice if it does come in.","11709":"I'm looking forward to it if it does!","11710":"Me too! It'd be great to have some cooler temperatures again.","11711":"Do you think the storm will last all week?","11712":"","11713":" let's just enjoy this sunny day while we can!\"","11714":"","11715":"","11716":"","11717":" \"Good advice! Sunburns are no fun at all...\"","11718":" \"Exactly - don't want any of us getting sick from being out in the heat for too long\"","11719":" \"You're right about that - I'm already feeling tired and dehydrated with these high temps\" 24, \" user24 \", \"Same here - but luckily there are plenty of cold drinks around to help us stay cool\" 25, \" user25 \", \"Ahh that sounds refreshing! Let's hope this heat wave ends soon though...\"","11720":"It's so hot outside! I'm sweating just walking to my car.","11721":"I hear you - it's been scorching here too. Is there any relief in sight?","11722":"Not that I can see. Even the trees seem to be wilting!","11723":"Maybe a storm will come soon and cool things off a bit.","11724":"That would be nice, but I think we have weeks of this heat left yet.","11725":"Let's hope for some thunderstorms at least!","11726":"Agreed. A change of pace would be much-needed.","11727":"In the meantime, let's stay inside and keep cool!","11728":"Remember watching 'The Magic Roundabout' when we were kids? Such a classic!","11729":"Ah yes! I loved that show. Do you remember 'Rainbow'?","11730":"That's the one with Zippy, George and Bungle right? That was my favorite show growing up.","11731":"Haha yeah! What about 'Postman Pat'? I used to watch that every Saturday morning.","11732":"Oh man, I haven't thought about that in years. Those were the days!","11733":"It's getting so hot outside!","11734":"I know! I can't wait for the rain to come.","11735":"It's not raining here yet. What about you guys?","11736":"No rain here either. We're all going to be melting soon!","11737":"That's why I'm staying inside as much as possible. I can't take this heat!","11738":"I'm trying to find ways to stay cool. Any ideas?","11739":"Running through a sprinkler is always a good idea!","11740":"Or just turn on the air conditioner and blast it.","11741":"My AC broke last week, so that's not an option for me.","11742":"That's too bad. Hopefully you can get it fixed soon.","11743":"Does anyone know any tips for keeping cool without AC?","11744":"Drink lots of cold water, and try to stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day.","11745":"Eating popsicles also helps me feel cooler when it's really hot out!","11746":"I heard that eating spicy food can help you sweat more and cool down faster.","11747":"I'm not sure if that works or not, but it might be worth a try!","11748":"Does anyone have any forecasts for when the heat wave will end?","11749":"I don't think there are any definite predictions right now but keep checking back in case something changes.","11750":"Any news on when we'll get some rain around here? It would be nice to get some relief from this heatwave.","11751":" \"There was talk of thunderstorms later this week, so fingers crossed we'll get some much needed precipitation soon!\"","11752":" \"Yes please! The weather has been unbearable lately. Let's hope for a change soon...\"","11753":"Does anyone else get a wave of nostalgia when watching old children's TV programmes?","11754":"Absolutely! I used to love watching those shows growing up. What show was your favorite?","11755":"My favourite pet is a cat.

I love how cats can always make you feel better with a cuddle.","11761":"My favourite pet is definitely a dog. There's something so comforting about having a loyal pup around.","11762":"That's true. Dogs are so sweet and they always show unconditional love.","11763":"My favourite pet is a rabbit! I love their playful personalities and all the fun tricks you can teach them.","11764":"Rabbits are amazing! I wish I could have one as a pet!","11765":"Hey everyone, do you have any nostalgic memories of childhood TV shows?","11766":"Oh definitely! I remember watching Hey Arnold almost every day after school!","11767":"I used to love Rugrats!

Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were always getting into crazy adventures.","11769":"Are we talking live-action or animated shows? Because if it's the former I would say Saved by the Bell was great!","11770":"That show was such a classic. Even now I can't help but sing along to the theme song when it plays on tv!","11771":"I'm more of an animated show fan myself. Spongebob Squarepants was one of my favourites growing up.","11772":"Totally agree with you there! Patrick Star and Squidward Tentacles were comedy gold.","11773":"When it comes to nostalgia nothing beats Tom & Jerry for me. It's such an iconic show that still stands the test of time!","11774":"Yup, those two crazy cats never fail to make me laugh. I also really enjoyed The Wild Thornberrys when I was younger.","11775":"Ah yes The Wild Thornberrys - that show had some amazing storylines and taught me so much about wildlife too!","11776":"I can relate - I loved watching Arthur. It was always so educational but in a fun way! Plus Buster Baxter was hilarious.","11777":"Oh yeah Arthur is definitely a classic! Has anyone here seen Courage the Cowardly Dog? That show used to freak me out sometimes haha","11778":"Lol yes it did have its creepy moments but it had some great episodes too. I also enjoyed watching Dexter's Laboratory growing up.","11779":"Me too! Dexter was always inventing something new, plus that catchy theme song will stay with me forever!","11780":"Yep same here - another one I watched religiously as a kid was Recess. Such a classic series with some really nice characters.","11781":"Oh absolutely - Mikey Blumberg, Gus Griswald and Spinelli were all such likable characters. And let's not forget Randall Weems...","11782":" \"Haha yeah Randall Weems was pure comic relief! Have any of you watched Doug? That show had some pretty interesting storylines\"","11783":" \"Definitely Doug - Skeeter Valentine and Patti Mayonnaise were my favourite characters though. What about Rocko's Modern Life?\"","11784":" \"Ah yes Rocko's Modern Life - another Nickelodeon classic that never fails to bring back fond memories from my childhood!\"","11785":" \"Can't forget about CatDog either - that show had some really unique humour which made it stand out from other cartoons\"","11786":" \"Agreed! My personal favourite though has got to be Hey Dude. It had this perfect balance between comedy and drama which kept us hooked until the end\"","11787":" \"Absolutely! Hey Dude had some really great episodes. What about As Told By Ginger? That one meant a lot to me growing up\"","11788":" \"Oh yeah As Told By Ginger definitely takes me back too. Another one of my all-time favourites is The Angry Beavers\"","11789":" \"Ah yes The Angry Beavers - Daggett and Norbert always managed to get into hilarious misadventures together! Anyone else watch Animaniacs?\"","11790":" \"Animaniacs for sure - Wakko Warner singing 'Yakko's World' will be with us forever haha. What about Rocket Power?\"","11791":" \"Rocket Power is one of those shows where you can just tell how much heart went into creating each episode. Speaking of which does anyone remember Dougie Houser MD?\"","11792":" \"'Dougie Houser MD' brings back so many fond memories from my childhood days... Ah nostalgia is sweet isn't it everyone?\"","11793":"My favorite pet is a cat because they're so cuddly and loving!","11794":"I agree! I love cats too, there's something so comforting about them.","11795":"Dogs are my favorite. They provide companionship and loyalty like no other pet can!","11796":"I'm a fan of both cats and dogs. It's hard to choose between the two.","11797":"I'm more of a bird person myself. They're so graceful and fun to watch.","11798":"Birds are great, but I think my favorite pet has to be a guinea pig. They're so adorable!","11799":"I'd have to say rabbits! They're gentle and make great cuddle buddies.","11800":"Fish are my top pick! Watching them swim around in their tank is always so calming.","11801":"You can't beat hamsters as far as cuteness goes! Plus they're quite low maintenance too.","11802":"Turtles are awesome! I love how slow-moving they are and that they can live for decades with proper care.","11803":"Horses get my vote - they have such an amazing spirit about them when you ride or just spend time with them.","11804":"I'm partial to reptiles myself. Lizards, chameleons, snakes - all fascinating creatures!","11805":"Ferrets make the best pets in my opinion - they're so mischievous and playful!","11806":"Goats are great - whether it's for milk or just for companionship. Plus, their personalities really shine through when you spend time with them.","11807":"Definitely rats! They're incredibly smart and affectionate animals who thrive on interaction with humans.","11808":"Loving ferrets isn't enough? You have to go ahead and bring goats into the mix too?! ;) ","11809":" \"Well if we're talking about exotic animals then I'd go for sugar gliders. They look like tiny flying squirrels!\"","11810":" \"Oh wow, I never even knew those existed! That sounds pretty cool!\"","11811":"Hi everyone!

I miss all of the old classics like Looney Tunes and Scooby Doo.","11839":"Yeah, those were the days! I used to get so excited to be able to watch TV all morning!","11840":"Oh man, the nostalgia is real. I especially miss Duck Tales and Tiny Toon Adventures.","11841":"Ahh, yes!

I used to love Rugrats and Hey Arnold when I was younger. What kind of shows are you watching?","11849":"Oh man, I'm definitely revisiting all the classics - the old Disney movies, Tom & Jerry, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - those were the best!","11850":"Ah yes, I remember those.
