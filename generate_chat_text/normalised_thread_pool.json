    "12": "Agreed! Dogs are definitely the best when it comes to building relationships with humans. Plus, they understand us in ways other animals don't!",
    "13": "I prefer cats myself because of their independence - they don't need constant attention or supervision like some other pets do.",
    "14": "That's true but I also like how cats can still form strong bonds with their owners if given enough time and dedication.",

    "837": " \"And no matter how much technology advances, they'll still be timeless classics!\"",
    "838": "My favourite pet is a cat because they are so cuddly and loving!",
    "839": "I can't get enough of my little puppy! They're always so eager to play and show love.",
    "840": "I love my hamster - they're so cute and often quite cheeky!",
    "841": "My turtle is the best. He's so slow and gentle that I can relax when I'm around him.",
    "842": "Birds are definitely my favourite! So much personality in such a small package.",
    "843": "I adore my rabbit! She loves to hop around and explore the house.",
    "844": "I'm more of a fish person - their tanks are so peaceful to look at and their colors are beautiful!",
    "845": "That's true, fish tanks make great decorations. Plus, it's fun watching them swim around!",
    "846": "Agreed! Even though cats are adorable too, nothing beats the energy of a puppy.",
    "847": "Aha, I know what you mean! Hamsters have such funny personalities that make me laugh every time I see them.",
    "848": "I recently started re-watching some of my favorite 90s kids TV shows and it's been so much fun!",
    "849": "That sounds great! I used to love Rugrats and Hey Arnold when I was younger. What kind of shows are you watching?",

    "851": "Ah yes, I remember those. It's weird how even though they're so old now they still bring back such vivid memories.",
    "852": "It's amazing how these shows have stood the test of time. Seeing them as an adult is a completely different experience too.",
    "853": "Agreed! Even though there are plenty of new kids TV shows out there, nothing compares to the nostalgia of watching these classic cartoons.",
    "854": "That's true. It's nice to have something from your childhood that you can share with your own children now.",

    "870": "It's really cloudy outside today. I heard it might rain later.",
    "871": "Yeah it has been that way all day. I'm hoping the forecast is wrong!",
    "872": "I'm looking forward to it. Rainy days are so cozy.",
    "873": "True, but I have plans later so I don't want it to be too wet!",
    "874": "I think the weather is going to hold for a bit longer. It's just the clouds that make it look like it's about to rain.",
    "875": "That would be great! I need to go out and do some errands.",
    "876": "Maybe we'll get lucky and the sun will come out soon!",

    "882": "No snow here in Florida! We don't see much of that around here anyways.",
    "883": "Not like up north where you get those huge snowstorms!",
    "884": "Yep! Last winter was especially bad with all of those blizzards and ice storms.",
    "885": "Man, I remember having to shovel my driveway almost every morning. That was no fun!",
    "886": "Well hopefully this year will be better. We could use some good weather after last year!",
    "887": "Agreed! Let's keep our fingers crossed that we get a mild winter this time around.",
    "888": " \"In any case, I think we should enjoy this nice weather while we still can before things start cooling off again.\"",

    "890": " \"My kids are already dreading having to go back to school in a few weeks!\"",
    "891": " \"At least they can enjoy these sunny days while they're still here!\"",
    "892": " \"Yup! Maybe we can squeeze in one last family outing before school starts?\" 24, \"userX\", \"Sounds like a plan! Maybe take a trip down to the beach or something?\" 25 , \"userY\", \"That sounds fun! Just make sure you check the forecast first before you head out...you never know when there might be a surprise thunderstorm or two!\" 26 , \"userZ\", \"Good idea! Better safe than sorry when it comes to these summer storms\"",

    "904": "Me too! I used to love Power Rangers and Pokemon.",
    "905": "Ahhh the nostalgia! I think my favorite was Digimon.",
    "906": "Oh that brings back so many memories! Even though kids TV shows aren't what they used to be, there's still a few good ones like My Little Pony and Adventure Time.",
    "907": "Those are great! But nothing beats the classics like Rugrats and Hey Arnold!",
    "908": "Exactly! I also loved Batman Beyond, The Wild Thornberrys, and Doug!",
    "909": "Those are all such great shows. But Don't forget about The Simpsons and Spongebob Squarepants!",

    "956": "Oh no, that doesn't sound good. I don't like storms!",
    "957": "Me either. Hopefully they won't be too bad if they do come",
    "958": "Yeah, let's stay positive and hope for the best!",
    "959": "Exactly! We'll just have to wait and see what happens with the weather.",

    "979": "Exactly - plus, I find them super interesting because of their intelligence and curiosity. That's why I fell in love with mine!",

    "992": "Rabbits are great pets! I've had one since I was a kid.",
    "993": "I prefer reptiles as pets. Snakes and lizards can be really interesting.",
    "994": "Yes, reptiles make great pets too! You just need to give them the right environment.",

    "1003": " \"If you want an even smaller pet then gerbils might be the right choice for you. They're intelligent animals that can easily bond with their owners.\"",
    "1004": " \"Gerbils definitely deserve more recognition as pets! It's amazing how much personality they have in such small bodies.\"",
    "1005": " \"Hedgehogs also make wonderful pets if you're looking for something different. Their spines may seem scary but they're actually quite gentle creatures if handled properly.\"",
    "1006": " \"That's right! Hedgehogs can be great little companions for those who don't mind cleaning up after them a bit more than other types of animals!\"",
    "1007": "I'm feeling so nostalgic for old children's TV shows!",
    "1008": "Me too! I miss my Saturday morning cartoons!",
    "1009": "I used to love watching Arthur and Sesame Street!",

    "1428": "Rabbits are my favourite - they're so cuddly and soft!",
    "1429": "That's great! We all have different preferences but I think it's cool that we can come together over our shared love of animals.",

    "1482": "Ohhh yeah! I never missed an episode of that one either. Those two were my favorites for sure.",
    "1483": "Ahh, nostalgia isn't it? Nothing quite like our childhood TV shows.",

    "1500": "Right now I have some Bearded Dragons, a Chinese Water Dragon and a few Geckos!",
    "1501": "That sounds awesome - I've always wanted to get one of those as a pet!",
    "1502": "Me too! Although I think I'll stick with my hamster for now.",
    "1503": "I love cats because they are so cuddly and fun to be around!",

    "1514": "Turtles may not be as cuddly as some other pets, but they can be quite affectionate too.",
    "1515": "That's true - cats really do seem to have their own minds and don't always listen to us humans! :)",
    "1516": "It's hilarious when they get into mischief without even meaning to!",
    "1517": "Exactly! Rabbits also have that mischievous streak which makes them so fun to watch!",
    "1518": "Turtles don't do much in terms of playing around, but they sure look adorable when they sleep!",

    "1531": "It looks like temperatures will stay pretty steady in the next few weeks.",
    "1532": "That's good news. I don't think my AC can handle any more heat than what we've already had this summer!",
    "1533": "I heard there might be some rain coming our way soon. That should help cool things down a bit.",
    "1534": "That would be nice. We haven't seen rain in a while now.",
    "1535": "Yeah, it definitely seems like it's been dry lately. Fingers crossed for some precipitation soon!",

    "1561": "Me too! I can't wait to wear shorts and tank tops again.",
    "1562": "Same here. But it looks like we might get some rain this week.",
    "1563": "Ugh, really? That's too bad. I was hoping for a nice sunny week.",
    "1564": "Me too! But at least it'll cool down a bit before the real heat kicks in.",
    "1565": "Yeah, that's true. Maybe we'll get lucky and the rain will pass quickly!",

    "1676": "Ahh, I'm still so fond of the memories of Doug and his alter-ego Quailman.",
    "1677": "Oh yeah! I miss the old Nickelodeon shows like The Wild Thornberrys too!",
    "1678": "It's not just Nickelodeon. Remember when Disney had Doug on their channel?",
    "1679": "Of course! I almost forgot about Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Bear in the Big Blue House.",
    "1680": "Oh yes, those were great! Nowadays there are so many new shows that it's hard to keep up with them all.",
    "1681": "Yup, it's definitely a different world now compared to when we were younger. It was nice to have a few familiar shows that aired on a regular basis!",
    "1682": "Agreed! Do any other forum members have any fond memories from their childhoods?",
    "1683": "Absolutely! Recess was one of my favorites. It taught me how to deal with bullies and make friends at school.",
    "1684": "Recess was awesome. Also remember Rocko's Modern Life? Those were good times!",
    "1685": "Yup! The mix of cartoons between the 90s and early 2000s was incredible. We should be thankful for those moments.",
    "1686": "Definitely! Let's cherish the nostalgia while looking forward to what new cartoons will come out in the future :)",
    "1687": "My favourite pet is a dog because they are loving and loyal!",
    "1688": "I agree, dogs make great pets! I also love cats for their playful nature.",

    "1695": "Ferrets are amazing too - they're very intelligent and curious creatures.",
    "1696": "Horses are my go-to. They are majestic animals with immense strength and beauty.",
    "1697": " \"That's true, horses are really majestic! I'd also like to add that guinea pigs make great pets as well - they're so gentle and calm.\"",
    "1698": " \"Guinea pigs definitely deserve a shoutout! What about goats? You don't see many people keeping them as pets but they can be really fun too.\"",
    "1699": " \"Goats are awesome! They have such unique personalities. I think it's important to remember that all animals should be treated with respect and kindness regardless of whether we keep them as pets or not.\"",
    "1700": " \"Exactly! We should all strive to understand our furry friends better, no matter the species. Rats are often overlooked as pets but they can actually be quite affectionate too!\"",
    "1701": " \"Rats definitely get a bad rep sometimes, but if you give them lots of love and attention then you'll definitely get it back from them. What about snakes?\"",
    "1702": " \"Snakes can make great pets too if you know how to handle them properly. They can live quite long lives if looked after correctly.\"",
    "1703": " \"Yes, that's true! Besides reptiles, we shouldn't forget about amphibians either - frogs, salamanders, axolotls etc. All have their own charm and personality.\"",
    "1704": " \"Absolutely! Many people don't know this but even invertebrates such as hermit crabs or spiders can make good pets too. It just takes some patience and understanding.\"",
    "1705": " \"Wow that's interesting! You learn something new every day. The same goes for exotic insects like tarantulas or beetles - it may not be everyone's cup of tea but it could still be rewarding for those willing to give it a go!\"",
    "1706": " \"Interesting points everyone. Let\u2019s not forget about farm animals either; goats, cows etc. Although these require more work than other smaller domesticated animals, they offer plenty of joy in return\".",
    "1707": "I have a cat! They're so playful and loving. My cat always curls up on my lap when I'm feeling down.",
    "1708": "My favorite pet is a dog! They are loyal and friendly, I can't imagine life without them!",
    "1709": "I just adopted a rabbit! Rabbits are great companions and they always make me laugh.",

    "1725": "Yup! Also can't forget about Doug either. Such a classic!",
    "1726": "Absolutely. He always had such interesting stories to tell.",
    "1727": "Yes! Also don't forget about 'Recess'. It was so great!",
    "1728": "For sure. It really captured the school playground experience well.",
    "1729": "I also loved watching 'Arthur' when I was younger!",
    "1730": "Ah yes, that show taught us some pretty important lessons too!",
    "1731": "It sure did! And let's not forget about the great adventures in 'The Magic School Bus'.",
    "1732": "That show was educational and so much fun at the same time!",
    "1733": "Exactly! There were just so many great shows growing up.",

    "1736": " \"Lol same here but it is still one of my favorites. What about 'The Wild Thornberrys'?\"",
    "1737": " \"Oh yeah! Those episodes were always filled with adventure and excitement!\"",
    "1738": " \"No doubt about it! Too bad those shows aren't around anymore...\"",
    "1739": " \"Yeah it's sad to think that kids nowadays don't have these same experiences\"",
    "1740": " \"Agreed. But at least we have lots of memories to look back on fondly\"",
    "1741": " \"Well said. Let's cherish them while we can :)",
    "1742": "It's been so cold lately! Does anyone else feel like it's getting colder?",
    "1743": "Yes, definitely! I heard that we might be in for some snow this week too.",
    "1744": "That would be cool! I hope it happens soon.",
    "1745": "Me too! I'm ready for some winter weather!",
    "1746": "It's so hot outside today!",
    "1747": "Yeah, I heard it's going to be even hotter tomorrow!",
    "1748": "Ugh, I'm not looking forward to that. I hope it cools down soon.",
    "1749": "Me too. Maybe we'll get some rain this week.",
    "1750": "It's been so hot lately!",

    "1762": "I heard they're predicting thunderstorms later this week.",
    "1763": "That would be great news if it comes true!",
    "1764": "Yes, I hope it does. We need the precipitation desperately.",
    "1765": " \"Let's keep our fingers crossed that the forecast is right!\"",
    "1766": " \"Definitely - anything to break the heat wave would be welcome!\"",
    "1767": "My favourite pet is a dog because they are so loyal and loving!",
    "1768": "I agree, dogs are great pets! I also really like cats because they're so independent.",
    "1769": "I'm a big fan of rabbits. They're so cute and cuddly!",
    "1770": "I love turtles! They're so low maintenance and can live for a long time.",
    "1771": "Fish are my go-to pet. They're peaceful and look great in an aquarium.",
    "1772": "I love birds because they can be very entertaining to watch.",
    "1773": "Horses are amazing creatures - I'm always in awe of them when I see them out in the fields or galloping around a show ring!",
    "1774": "Hamsters are such fun little pets with lots of personality!",
    "1775": "Guinea pigs are another one of my favourites - they have such unique personalities as well!",
    "1776": "Reptiles like snakes and lizards make for interesting pets too - especially for people who don't want to spend lots of time taking care of their pet.",
    "1777": "My favourite pet has to be my dog - he's been my best friend since puppyhood and I love him more than anything else in the world!",
    "1778": "My favourite pet is a cat! They're so adorable and cuddly!",
    "1779": "I love dogs! They're such loyal companions and they always make me laugh.",
    "1780": "I'm more of a small animal person myself. Hamsters are the cutest!",
    "1781": "Birds are my favourite. I love how they can fly and sing beautiful songs.",
    "1782": "Snakes are definitely my go-to pet! They're interesting to watch and always so relaxed.",
    "1783": "Fish are the best! Watching them swim around in their tanks is so calming.",
    "1784": "Rabbits are so sweet and fluffy, I can't resist them!",
    "1785": "That's true, rabbits do have an irresistible charm!",
    "1786": "I totally agree! All pets have something special about them that makes them unique.",
    "1787": "Exactly! No matter what your favourite pet is, it's sure to bring joy into your life.",
    "1788": "It's been so hot lately! Anybody else feeling it?",
    "1789": "I sure am! I've been staying indoors to avoid the heat.",
    "1790": "Yeah, it's definitely warmer than usual. Does anyone have any good ideas for keeping cool?",
    "1791": "I like to stay in air conditioned rooms and drink lots of water. What about you guys?",
    "1792": "I've been going for walks early in the morning when it's cooler outside. It helps!",
    "1793": "That's a great idea! I'm going to try that out too.",
    "1794": "Swimming is also a good way to keep cool. Anyone know of any public pools nearby?",
    "1795": "My local gym has an indoor pool. That might be your best bet!",
    "1796": " \"Great advice - thanks everyone!\"",
    "1797": "I'm feeling so nostalgic for the old childrens' TV programmes.",

    "1802": "Ah yes! I watched that every day after school!",
    "1803": "It's hard to believe how many classic shows we had back then. I still watch some of them when I can find them on reruns.",
    "1804": "Yeah, it's amazing how timeless those shows are. It's like they never really went away!",
    "1805": "I know what you mean. Are there any other shows you guys remember fondly?",

    "1808": "Oh yeah, and don't forget about Rugrats! That was always a hit in our house.",
    "1809": "Ahh, Rugrats... It's been so long since I watched that show. That theme song still sticks in my head!",
    "1810": "Haha same here. They just don't make shows like these anymore!",
    "1811": "No they don't! Can you believe some of these shows are over 20 years old now?!",
    "1812": " \"That's wild! So much has changed since then but it's nice to be able to look back and reminisce about childhood favorites.\"",
    "1813": " \"Agreed. Sometimes it feels like those days were just yesterday.\"",
    "1814": " \"Exactly! Nostalgia is powerful stuff isn't it?\"",
    "1815": " \"Definitely. It brings back so many memories from simpler times.\"",
    "1816": " \"Yes it does. I'm glad we can talk about these moments and keep them alive in our minds for years to come!\"",

    "1822": "I heard some thunder earlier. We may get a storm soon!",
    "1823": "I'm in Arizona and it's still pretty warm out.",
    "1824": "Here in Montana it's finally starting to cool off a bit.",
    "1825": "It's raining cats and dogs here in Oregon!",
    "1826": "In New York, it's been really muggy lately.",
    "1827": "It looks like we're going to get some snow this year.",
    "1828": "Really? That would be great!",
    "1829": "Yeah, I'm excited for winter activities!",
    "1830": "I'm from Hawaii so I never really see snow, but I hear it can be fun!",
    "1831": "Snow can be nice but sometimes it gets too cold for me...",
    "1832": "Well at least you don't have to deal with extreme heat like we do down south!",
    "1833": " \"Hmm, that sounds rough. Where I am right now the temperature is just right\"",
    "1834": " \"That sounds perfect! I wish my area was like that\"",
    "1835": " \"Me too! The humidity here can be unbearable sometimes\"",
    "1836": " \"Ugh yeah, same here. But at least we can go swimming when it gets too hot\"",

    "1840": "Did you hear about the storm coming this weekend?",
    "1841": "Yes, I heard it's supposed to be a bad one!",
    "1842": "That's too bad. I'm hoping it won't affect my plans this weekend.",
    "1843": "It's so hot and humid today!",
    "1844": "I know! It's unbearable. I'm already sweating.",
    "1845": "Does anyone know what the temperature is outside?",
    "1846": "It's around 100 degrees Fahrenheit here.",
    "1847": "Wow, that's way too hot. I hope it cools down soon.",
    "1848": "Yeah, I don't think I can take much more of this heat!",
    "1849": "I heard there are thunderstorms in the forecast for tonight.",
    "1850": "That would be a welcome relief from this heat wave!",
    "1851": "Yes, rain would be great right now.",
    "1852": "Let's keep our fingers crossed that it actually happens!",
    "1853": "So what else has been going on with the weather lately?",
    "1854": "I've heard reports of high winds in some areas recently.",
    "1855": "That sounds dangerous! Hopefully everyone stays safe.",
    "1856": "I heard there was a tornado warning earlier this week in another state.",
    "1857": "That must have been scary for those affected by it.",
    "1858": "Definitely. It can be difficult to stay safe during severe weather conditions like that.",
    "1859": "Has anyone seen any reports of snow in their area?",
    "1860": "Not yet! But it is still early in the season, so we should expect some eventually.",
    "1861": "Do you think we'll get any snow where we are?",
    "1862": "Maybe! We haven't had any for a few years now so who knows!",
    "1863": " \"Snow would be nice but I'd rather have cooler temperatures without all the wetness!\"",
    "1864": " \"Agreed. Maybe Mother Nature will surprise us with both!\"",
    "1865": " \"Stranger things have happened! Let's keep our eyes on the forecast and see what happens next...\"",
    "1866": " \"Sounds like a plan! Stay tuned and hopefully we'll get something good soon :)\"",
    "1867": "I used to love watching the old Disney cartoons when I was a kid!",
    "1868": "Oh yes, I remember them! Especially classics like The Lion King and Aladdin.",
    "1869": "Do any of you guys remember the old Nickelodeon shows? My favorite was Rugrats!",
    "1870": "I do! That show was hilarious. And hey, did anyone here watch Hey Arnold?",
    "1871": "Yes, definitely! Hey Arnold was one of my favorites too. It was so nostalgic!",
    "1872": "Ahh, I miss those days! What about everyone else? Any other shows you all miss?",
    "1873": "Oh yeah, I used to adore Powerpuff Girls and Courage the Cowardly Dog!",
    "1874": "Those were great shows. But what about Spongebob Squarepants? Now that's a classic for sure.",
    "1875": "It sure is! Nothing quite beats Spongebob for nostalgia. Anyone else have anything to add?",
    "1876": "It's so hot outside! I'm sweating just walking to my car.",
    "1877": "I hear you - it's been scorching here too. Is there any relief in sight?",
    "1878": "Not that I can see. Even the trees seem to be wilting!",
    "1879": "Maybe a storm will come soon and cool things off a bit.",
    "1880": "That would be nice, but I think we have weeks of this heat left yet.",
    "1881": "Let's hope for some thunderstorms at least!",
    "1882": "Agreed. A change of pace would be much-needed.",
    "1883": "In the meantime, let's stay inside and keep cool!",
    "1884": "My favourite pet is a cat because they're very low maintenance and cuddly.",
    "1885": "I love cats too! I think they make great companions.",
    "1886": "My favourite pet is a dog. They are so loyal and loving!",
    "1887": "Dogs are great! I also love rabbits because they're so cute and fluffy.",
    "1888": "That's true! Rabbits can be lots of fun to play with.",
    "1889": "I agree- rabbits have so much personality!",
    "1890": "My favourite type of dog is a Labrador Retriever. They are so gentle and friendly!",
    "1891": "Labradors are lovely! I used to have a hamster when I was younger. They're really easy to take care of and you can watch them play which is really fun.",
    "1892": "Hamsters make great pets for kids! They don't require much space either.",
    "1893": "That's true! I had one when I was younger as well. It was really fun to watch it run around the cage.",
    "1894": "I've heard that guinea pigs make good pets too. They're quite social animals so they need lots of attention though!",
    "1895": "Guinea pigs can be very sweet if you give them enough time and care. It's important to research the breed before getting one though!",
    "1896": "Absolutely! All pets need lots of love and attention in order to thrive.",
    "1897": "That's so true. Even if they don't require as much physical activity or space as a larger pet like a dog or cat would need.",
    "1898": "Exactly- all pets deserve plenty of love no matter what kind they are!",
    "1899": "Agreed! Pets bring such joy into our lives and it's important that we give back to them in return.",
    "1900": "It sure is a sunny day today!",
    "1901": "Yes! I think we're in for a hot summer this year.",
    "1902": "It's been raining all day!",
    "1903": "I know, I'm hoping it clears up soon!",
    "1904": "I heard that the forecast is calling for sunny skies in a few days!",
    "1905": "That's great news! I'm looking forward to it.",
    "1906": "Me too! The rain has been so gloomy lately.",
    "1907": "I don't mind the rain. Just make sure you bring an umbrella with you when you go out!",
    "1908": "Good idea! Thanks for the reminder.",
    "1909": "I love cats because they're so affectionate and intelligent.",
    "1910": "I totally agree! My cat is my best friend.",
    "1911": "That's awesome! My favourite pet is a dog. They're loyal and always ready to play!",
    "1912": "That's true. Dogs are great companions.",
    "1913": "Definitely. I've had cats my whole life, but I think it would be fun to try owning a dog sometime.",
    "1914": "It's definitely worth it! You can go on lots of fun adventures with your pup.",
    "1915": "Agreed. Pets can bring us so much joy and companionship.",
    "1916": "Absolutely! What other pets do you guys like?",
    "1917": "I also really like rabbits! They're so soft and cuddly, and they make great house pets.",

    "1919": "Yeah, I think guinea pigs are really cool too. They have such unique personalities!",
    "1920": "Yes, that's true. Their little noises are so funny!",
    "1921": "Haha yeah! What about reptiles? Do you guys have any experience with them?",
    "1922": "Actually yes, my brother has a snake that he loves taking care of. He says they need less maintenance than most other pets.",
    "1923": "That's true! Reptiles are especially great for people who don't have time for more demanding animals like dogs or cats.",
    "1924": "Interesting. What kind of animal do you think would make the best pet?",
    "1925": "That's a tough one... But I'd say cats or dogs because they provide unconditional love and companionship in a way that no other pet can match!",
    "1926": "Definitely agree with that one. Cats and dogs will always be my favorite pets!",
    "1927": " \"Aww that's sweet! How about birds? Are they good pets?\"",
    "1928": " \"Yes, birds can be great pets if you're willing to put in the effort to take care of them properly - they require lots of attention!\"",
    "1929": " \"Exactly - plus they look beautiful when their feathers shine in the sunlight!\"",
    "1930": " \"Oh wow - sounds like birds would be really rewarding to own!\"",
    "1931": " \"They sure are - though there is some risk involved since they can sometimes fly away if not supervised properly\"",
    "1932": " \"That's true - but with proper training/care you should be able to enjoy having your bird as a companion for many years\"",
    "1933": "My favourite pet is a dog because they're so loyal.",
    "1934": "I also love dogs, but I think cats are the best. They're so independent and don't need as much attention.",
    "1935": "I'm a big fan of rabbits! They're so cute and cuddly!",
    "1936": "I have to agree with User 3 - rabbits are the cutest. Plus, they can be litter trained!",
    "1937": "My favourite pet is a horse. There's something about their intelligence and beauty that's just mesmerizing.",
    "1938": "Fish are great too! They don't require much maintenance and you can watch them swim around in their tank all day long.",
    "1939": "I'm more of a bird person - I love how they can fly and make sounds. It's really peaceful to listen to them sing.",
    "1940": "Guinea pigs are adorable! They're so small and gentle, plus they have such cute little faces!",
    "1941": "I like lizards because they can be fun to watch scurry around. And some of them even change colours!",
    "1942": "Hamsters are awesome because they're always on the go! Watching them run in their wheel is the best entertainment ever.",
    "1943": "My absolute favourite pet is a turtle - they're slow but cute, plus you get to watch them grow from tiny babies into big adults!",
    "1944": "What a beautiful day we're having!",
    "1945": "It is so nice out today! I'm planning to go for a walk.",
    "1946": "I wish it would stay like this all year round!",
    "1947": "I hear the forecast is calling for rain later in the week.",
    "1948": "That's too bad. I had plans of going to the beach this weekend.",
    "1949": "Maybe it will clear up by Saturday. Fingers crossed!",
    "1950": "I heard there's a chance of snow later in the month.",
    "1951": "Snow? That doesn't seem right for this time of year...",
    "1952": "It's not unheard of - last year we had snow in March!",

    "2339": "Oh yeah and Rocket Power too! There's nothing like a good beach day adventure",
    "2340": "Yup and what about Doug? Man that guy never had any luck with Patti Mayonnaise",
    "2341": "Ah yes definitely hahaha. Speaking of luck, remember Catdog? Man those two were always getting into trouble.",
    "2342": "Yeah but at least they had each others backs in the end. Let's not forget Recess: School's Out too!",

    "3340": " \"Try not to go outside too much during the peak daylight hours. That always makes it worse for me.\"",
    "3341": " \"Yeah, and make sure you drink plenty of water - that'll help keep you cool too.\"",
    "3342": " \"What about using fans? Does anyone know if those work better than ACs?\"",
    "3343": " \"Fans definitely help circulate air and might be cheaper than getting an AC unit installed. However, they won't actually lower the temperature of a room.\"",
    "3344": " \"Ah okay. Thanks for clarifying - good thing I already have an AC unit then!\"",
    "3345": " \"Haha yeah same here. Any other advice on dealing with this heatwave everyone? Let's brainstorm!\"",
    "3346": " \"Maybe eating cold foods like ice cream and popsicles could help distract from the heat a bit?\"",
    "3347": " \"That sounds like a great plan! Who else has any ideas to add?\"",
    "3348": "I used to love watching the Rugrats on Nickelodeon when I was a kid!",
    "3349": "Totally! There was nothing like that show. It had such an amazing cast of characters.",
    "3350": "Oh man, I miss watching Spongebob Squarepants on Saturday mornings. Those were the days!",

    "3354": "I'm so nostalgic for classic children's TV shows. What was your favorite?",
    "3355": "Definitely the 'Bear in the Big Blue House' show! I watched it religiously when I was a kid.",
    "3356": "Oh yeah, I remember that one. How about 'The Magic School Bus'? It was my absolute favorite!",
    "3357": "That show was amazing! I loved all of the science facts that Ms. Frizzle taught us.",
    "3358": "It was definitely a classic! I also really liked 'Eureeka's Castle'.",
    "3359": "Omg yes! That show had such great educational segments. Do you remember 'Reading Rainbow'?",
    "3360": "Of course! It made reading seem so fun and interesting!",
    "3361": "Exactly! I always looked forward to seeing what books they would feature each week.",
    "3362": "Ahh, nostalgia! What about 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?' That show gave me so many nightmares!",
    "3363": "Haha yes, it definitely did have some creepy moments. But I still loved it!",

    "3366": "Yes, but it was also really entertaining and funny at times. How about 'Doug'?",
    "3367": "Oh yeah definitely! Doug Funnie was always getting into some sort of trouble lol",
    "3368": "Yup - good old Doug Funnie. What about 'Rocko's Modern Life'? That show was hilarious!",
    "3369": "Oh man, Rocko's Modern Life definitely gave me a lot of laughs as a kid. Any other shows that everyone remembers fondly?",
    "3370": "What about 'Rugrats'? That show always had something new and exciting happening every episode.",
    "3371": "It's so hot outside today!",
    "3372": "Tell me about it! I can't believe it's still this warm in October.",
    "3373": "The humidity is making it feel even worse. I'm sweating buckets!",
    "3374": "I heard the heat wave will last a few more days, unfortunately.",
    "3375": "I'm so glad I have air conditioning in my house!",
    "3376": "Me too. It's been a lifesaver this summer.",
    "3377": "I hope the weather cools down soon. I'm so ready for fall to start.",
    "3378": "It's definitely been an unusually warm season this year.",
    "3379": "That's for sure! Especially here in the south where it tends to be hot anyway.",
    "3380": "Maybe we'll get lucky and have an early frost soon that will help cool things off a bit.",
    "3381": "I've been keeping an eye on the forecast and it looks like temperatures should drop soon.",
    "3382": "That would be great! I'm just trying to keep cool until then.",
    "3383": "Same here. It's been hard to stay comfortable with all this heat outside.",
    "3384": " \"Well, let's just hope the cold front comes through quickly!\"",
    "3385": " \"Yeah, that would be much appreciated!\"",
    "3386": " \"Absolutely! Fingers crossed it happens sooner rather than later!\"",
    "3387": "I'm so nostalgic for kids' TV shows! I loved watching Hey Arnold!",
    "3388": "Same here! I think Rugrats was my favourite.",
    "3389": "Ahh, yes - all the classic Nickelodeon cartoons. What about Doug?",
    "3390": "Yes! Doug was great. I also used to watch Recess a lot when I was younger.",
    "3391": "Oh wow, Recess! That brings back memories. What about Arthur?",
    "3392": "Oh yeah, Arthur! He was really funny. Does anyone remember The Magic School Bus?",
    "3393": "That's right! How could I forget that one? It was so educational!",
    "3394": "It sure was - and it had such a catchy theme song too!",
    "3395": "Agreed! Do any of you remember Rocket Power?",
    "3396": "Yup! That show had some great characters and plots. So many great shows from our childhoods!",
    "3397": "Indeed! Nostalgia for these shows will always be strong.",
    "3398": "Man, it's hot out there today!",

    "3408": "I like guinea pigs because they are sociable animals that love to play around!",
    "3409": "Reptiles can make great pets too! I especially like snakes because they require low maintenance.",
    "3410": "Horses are my top pick. Nothing beats being able to ride on one's back in the open air!",
    "3411": "Dogs are great companions but I prefer cats because they're less work and more independent.",
    "3412": "I'm partial to ferrets - they're funny, playful, and curious creatures with lots of energy!",
    "3413": "Goats make wonderful pets! Not only do they provide milk but also lots of fun with their antics.",
    "3414": "My beloved pet is a turtle. It's quiet, low-maintenance, and has a long life span.",
    "3415": "I'm partial to lizards as pets. They come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and personalities!",

    "3429": "I used to love watching 'Rugrats'. It was always so funny!",
    "3430": "I watched that too! And 'Hey Arnold!' -that show had some great episodes.",
    "3431": "Definitely. So many good shows back in the day!",

    "3439": "I like to keep things simple - my favorite pet has to be fish. So peaceful and calming to watch them swim around their tank.",
    "3440": "That's true! Fish can bring such a tranquil atmosphere to any room.",
    "3441": "Rabbits are the best! They're so adorable and full of personality!",
    "3442": "I totally agree! Plus, rabbits don't require as much space as other pets do, so they're great for people with limited living spaces.",
    "3443": "I'm feeling so nostalgic today - I was thinking about all the great kids shows I used to watch!",
    "3444": "Oh man, me too! I loved watching Power Rangers and Hey Arnold growing up.",

    "3562": "Yeah, dogs really do form strong bonds with their owners - it's incredible to witness.",
    "3563": "Rabbits make great pets because they don't require too much attention, yet they still show affection when you spend time with them.",
    "3564": "Reptiles need specialized care if you want them to live long, healthy lives. It's definitely a commitment but worth it in the end.",

    "3581": "Haha, that would definitely make for an interesting sight! I'd love to try it out.",
    "3582": "I think we should just keep our fingers crossed and hope for cooler temperatures instead!",

    "3613": "Same here! I miss being able to just sit down and watch those shows all day.",
    "3614": "Me too. Nowadays it seems like there's so many more adult-oriented programming that it can be hard to find good children's shows",
    "3615": "That's true. It's nice to take a break from our adult lives sometimes though and be reminded of what it was like as a child.",
    "3616": "Definitely! What other shows did you guys watch growing up?",

    "3641": "I used to love Clifford the Big Red Dog. The books were great, but so was the animated series!",
    "3642": "That's true - it was very cute and heartwarming at times. What about Bear in the Big Blue House?",
    "3643": "Definitely! Bear in the Big Blue House had some really catchy songs too. What about Animaniacs?",
    "3644": "Animaniacs was awesome - definitely one of my favorites from childhood. What about Rugrats?",

    "3656": " \"Tiny Toon Adventures taught me so much while being entertaining at the same time. And Angry Beavers never failed to make me laugh out loud!\"",
    "3657": " \"Agreed - those shows were fantastic! How about Courage the Cowardly Dog or Rocket Power?!\"",
    "3658": " \"Courage the Cowardly Dog always put me on edge with its suspenseful moments but also filled me with joy when he overcame his fears. And Rocket Power was a lot of fun too!\"",
    "3659": " \"Yes definitely- those shows were amazing! Has anybody here seen Recess: School's Out or All Grown Up?!\"",
    "3660": " \"Recess: School's Out still holds up today as an awesome movie- can't say the same for All Grown Up though...\"",
    "3661": " \"All Grown Up wasn't bad either- overall there have been some great classic children's TV programmes throughout history! Who remembers any others they want to share?",

    "3673": "That sounds perfect. I can't wait to get out and enjoy the sunshine!",
    "3674": "Me too! I hear they're calling for rain on Sunday, though.",
    "3675": "I hope not! We need some sun after all this rain we've been having.",
    "3676": "It looks like that's still up in the air. The forecast is changing every day.",
    "3677": "Well, at least the temperature should stay pretty comfortable no matter what happens with the rain!",
    "3678": "For sure. It'll be nice to have a break from all this cold weather we've been having lately.",
    "3679": "Agreed! I'm ready for springtime already.",
